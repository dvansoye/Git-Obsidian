For example, if the category is Supplements, then the output would be Supplements - Adaptogens, ALA, Alpha GPC, Antioxidants, Apigenin, Biotin, EGCG, etc. Let's go for three levels. So, Supplements would go under Health/Fitness like this Health/Fitness - Supplements - Adaptogens, ALA, Alpha GPC, Antioxidants, Apigenin, Biotin, EGCG, etc. There will be some interests that you can't categorize. That's fine. You can guess or put them under Uncategorized if you have no idea.`

# LLM Instructions

The following is a list of my interests. I created this from a list of concepts from Obsidian. I use these concepts to organize my notes. Just because an interest is listed doesn't mean I have a strong interest. It should be considered a "weak signal". The way to look at it is that I had an interest about this concept at a point in time. I may or may not have this interest any longer. Combine this with other information that I provide to make the determination on whether it is important or not.
