# My Life (So Far)


## Childhood

1. My brother has CP and was crippled since birth. He needed constant attention by my mother.
2. My mother was involved in a terrible car accident when I was 6 and was in near constant pain.
3. My dog was killed in a painful death in front of me when I was 6.
4. I was sexually molested when I was 6.
5. My father brags about me all the time. But, he gave me less encouragement and approval in person. Part of this was because he traveled a lot. For a time, he worked two jobs.

## Early Adulthood

1. As a teen, I was listless and got involved in drugs and alcohol starting in 8th grade. So I would have been 13?
2. Later, I took a computer programming class as an elective in my junior and senior years of high school based on a recommendation from my father who could already see the impact that computers were having in industry. I loved it.
3. I skated through my classes doing only as much as I needed to. I got a 3.3 GPA and 980/1170 SAT (I took it twice). Both are poor showings. But this was enough to get into University of California, Irvine in their Computer Science program.
4. I was ill prepared for college. I almost flunked out my first quarter. I stopped taking drugs and started studying. My grades improved by the time I finished my bachelor's. Other students would come to me for help in the computer lab.
5. I met Sandy my freshmen year. She was a big reason my studies improved. We got married after 5 years of dating while I still had one year left of my masters.
6. I got my MBA immediately after earning my bachelor's in Computer Science.
7. I got a summer internship before I started college and every summer thereafter programming. I had a full resume by the time I started full employment.
8. My mother died recently. My father is still going strong at 93. 

## Career Years

We took advantage of our opportunities. Things were different for young people today. Our tuition at UCI was $1200 a year our first year. It went up, but was highly subsidized by the state. We got a small inheritance when my grandparents died and put a down payment on a 30-year old house. We fixed it up on nights and weekends and moved again just before the bottom dropped out of the real estate market (in the early 90s). We lived on one income and paid off our mortgage in 13 years.

## Retirement

We retired at 49 and focused on travel. We visited 53 countries in 14 as part of the Trekking the Planet project. 55,000 students from nearly a thousand schools in 19 countries followed our journey. When we returned, we almost immediately started working on Race Across the USA which was a coast to coast Marathon series. Some of us ran the entire way including me. Yes, I ran from Huntington Beach to Washington DC over 3000 miles over 4 1/2 months. Since that time, we have completed other projects such as backpacking the PCT (2850 miles), hiking across Switzerland and the UK (twice) and visiting all of the national parks in the lower 48. 

# Meta-analysis

The goal of this section is to take your past and figure out how you can plot a map to your best life.

## My Neuroticism

I am moderately neurotic.

1. I fear getting sick. I wash my hands a lot.
2. I fear getting old.
3. I fear losing my mind.
4. I am afraid of getting obese.
5. I am concerned about the many crisis that our society faces today. This includes financial, ecological, political, etc. The US seems to be moving ever closer to civil war.

## My Habits

1. I watch 45 minutes of TV at night.
2. I view very little or no social media.
3. Instead, I am very focused on learning. 
4. When I get up, I roll right into studying. 
5. I exercise 7 days a week.
6. We make most of our meals when we are at home.
7. I try to get 8 hours of sleep every night.

## My Drives

1. Sandy and I were both neglected in certain respects. Our parents were busy and distracted and focused on their own problems. When we came together, I was fuel and Sandy was oxygen and together we went up like a rocket reinforcing the good behavior and eliminating the bad or less positive. We finished school, excelled in our jobs, raised our kids and retired early.
2. I have a sort of survivor's guilt. My brother is handicapped, my mom was hit by a truck and suffered from migraines the rest of her life, my dad was working two jobs to pay off debt. I was the only one left in a way. Why was I born normal, never got hurt and had free time? I felt and still feel a lot of pressure to perform. And the harder I work and the more I accomplished, the less I feel I can rest. It shows me that I can do far more than I ever thought. 
3. I often think about regrets I will have in my death bed. I also think about the loss of my physical and mental ability. I fear losing momentum. As a result, I tend to be very focused and very disciplined. That's because I'm working towards regret minimization.
