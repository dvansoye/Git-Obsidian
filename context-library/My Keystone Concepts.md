# Content

My overarching theme is [[Transcendence]]. I define this as intellectual and personal optimization that creates maximum leverage and freedom. I aspire to be cognitively enhanced, financially optimized, geographically flexible, and influential‚Äîessentially, to transcend normal human limitations through systematic application of technology and knowledge. This core drive informs almost all of my other goals and projects.

The path I will get there is through _Focus_. I'm struggling right now to balance many things:

1. Time with Sandy 
2. Time to exercise 
3. Studying 

I have broken [[Accelerated Learning]], into the following phases:

1. Acquire 
2. Consume 
3. Retain 
4. Apply

I am actively working to optimize all four.

Through [[Focus]] and [[Recursive Self-Improvement]].

# Focus

I'm trying to do too many things at once.

1. Review past notes 
2. Read my Readwise feed
3. Read my Readwise library 
4. Watch YouTube videos 
5. Google Discover 
6. Reddit 
7. Medium 
8. Synthetic Reports 
9. Read books that I have checked out

This is a lot of sources and I'm planning to add a new one: [[Prometheus]] which will deliver content based on my current goals. (I use the [[Epimetheus]] prompt to collect my implied goals from the prior month as input. This is another example of [[Recursive Self-Improvement|RSI]].)

Here are all of my information sources.

- [ ] Review past notes ‚è´ 
- [ ] Read my Readwise feed üîº 
- [ ] Read my Readwise library üîº 
- [ ] Watch YouTube videos üîΩ 
- [ ] Google Discover üîΩ 
- [ ] Reddit üîΩ 
- [ ] Medium üîΩ 
- [ ] Read books that I have checked out üîº 
- [ ] Synthetic Reports ‚è´ 

My strategy is to focus. Reviewing past notes doesn't seem like a high value task, but it has led to many breakthroughs. Google Discover and Reddit are mostly low value tasks. (So, stop looking at them.) And I would say YouTube videos are mostly that. They are often misinformation or information that I can't use (like what China is doing). Anyway, I can always go back to a focus on reading broadly later.

# Recursive Self-improvement 

Recently, I was struck by this idea that [[Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning]] could help me to improve my acquisition, comprehension, retention, and application of knowledge. And, it could help me to do this in an ever increasing way. Imagine an upward spiral. It starts as a small circle near the ground and grows upward with an ever increasing diameter. I'm learning how to learn. I'm telling the LLM my current practice and it is making recommendations on how I can improve it. I implement some of the recommendations, measure their effects and report back. It is recursive because I have a way to measure my progress. It is also recursive because I keep going back to the LLM for more collaboration. It is self improvement because I'm slowly getting better. I'm not focused on learning a subject. I'm focused on how to improve my process in order to learn everything faster, deeper, with better recall and with the ability to apply everything I learn to the questions in life.

# Synthetic Reports

Synthetic Reports are AI generated documents. Here are the different flavors.

1. Using the [[Summarization Suite]] of prompts, I can generate a one-paragraph summary, a vocabulary list, a chapter by chapter summary, a systems thinking analysis and a mental model analysis. The input is typically a book. But a long-form article or paper also works. Basically, instead of reading the whole thing, I am able to consume at a higher level. I always read the introduction of the book before summarization and, after I finish reading the chapter by chapter summary, I know where to focus my time. This has become increasingly important because I often read [[Syntopical Reading|Syntopically]] meaning that I read a lot of books on the same topic. The LLM demystifies the author's obscure terminology and provides helpful examples. The systems thinking and mental model analyses help me to see the material at a higher level and make connections between the concepts in other domains. 
2. I often create bespoke deep research reports on a particular topic. For example, I requested a Deep research report on the Ukraine war. I got the whole history starting from when it was part of the Soviet Union all the way up to Ukraine's recent use of drones to attack Russia's oil refining infrastructure.
3. I have been requesting Latticework reports. This is where I ask for a deep research report on an entire domain like military strategy, the game of chess or Immanuel Kant. What I'm asking for specifically are mental models. And I'm asking to see related mental models in other domains like business, biology, or physics. This gives a good understanding of the domain and associated connections. And this is the source of the mental models that become part of my mental model library which is used when processing the Mental Model deep research report mentioned above.

# Automation 

1. I store all of my prompts in GitHub. I also store all of my mental models there. This makes it convenient when I refer to them using Gemini. All I need to do is provide a link to my library and Gemini knows about all of my prompts by name. No more cutting and pasting.
2. Because I have all of my prompts in GitHub, I can refer to them by name. Recently, I automated the five prompts that make up the  [[Summarization Suite]] using [[Comet]]. All I need to do is to upload the document (book, PDF, etc.) and start Comet up. I can actually minimize the window and allow it to process.
3. Once all the prompts have been run, I have a way to convert the output into markdown and download it directly into Obsidian.
4. Once it is in Obsidian, I have a series of tools and scripts that reformat the text. I've had this for a while but I continue to make improvements. Once such improvement is to take all of my highlights and reactions to the text and place them at the beginning of the document which makes it easy to review what was important to me later. I plan to use AI here too by having it reorder, split, and merge the points so they make sense together and are easier to consume, retain and apply.
5. I've already mentioned [[Epimetheus]]. This prompt takes all of my diary entries for the past week or month and works backwards to my implied goals. 
6. The output of Epimetheus is input to another prompt that is run as a scheduled action. It is automatically run daily and the output is delivered to me as a report. I am notified when it is ready on my phone. So basically, Epimetheus captures what I'm working on and [[Prometheus]] finds others doing the same thing which will hopefully help me come up with new ideas. This is another example of [[Recursive Self-Improvement|RSI]]. And it is almost fully automated.

# Gamification

I'm just wondering how I can bring this altogether, unify it, and make it fun and exciting. How can I take the ideas above and make them more "generative". By generative, I mean that they help me make progress towards [[Transcendence]]. In other words, where are my [[üß©Leverage|high-leverage]] activities? [[Zettelkasten/Git-Obsidian/prompt-portfolio/cato|cato]] is one example. I have already thought about how to improve cato to focus on my highlights and reactions. Maybe I could make it brief. Maybe cato could defer to me and ask what sounds interesting? I see you have interest in this and this and this. What would you like to discuss? Or maybe you would like to discuss the synthesis of these two ideas. Or, I know you are also interested in X. Perhaps we could talk about how this topic relates to X? Maybe as I am reviewing something, I could mark it as a candidate with a hashtag and then come back to it. It would be a review of a review. The key is how to select them. I have a lot of things to review. Which ones will deliver the most value? It really goes back to the ideas of Transcendence, Focus and my current goals as captured by [[Epimetheus]].

# Going Forward

I think I will pass on actual goals. Instead, I will use [[Epimetheus]] to capture implied goals. And, I will use implied goals as a springboard to generate new ideas for future efforts.
