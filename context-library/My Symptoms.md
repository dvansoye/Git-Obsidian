## Background

- I'm 63, male, white, of European decent, and in generally good health. 
- I weigh 164 and am 5'10" tall. 
- I exercise every day. I walk, run, swim in the morning. I lift weights in the afternoon and I take a walk after dinner.

## History

- I'm a retired ultra runner.
- I ran marathons, and ultra marathons plus an iron man.
- In 2015, I ran 112 back to back marathons across the US (over 4 1/2 months).
- In 2016, I backpacked most of the PCT. I completed 1850 miles (also over 4 1/2 months). I lost 30 lbs.
- In 2017 I drove around the US visiting US National Parks. I got very little exercise this year. This is when I got tinnitus.
- Since then, I have stayed active. For example, today I ran 3 miles (slowly).
- I still do extreme things. Last year, I backpacked from Lake Geneva to Rome (around 10 miles a day over two months with some extreme heat). Does that change things?

## Symptoms

- My mind tends to be "busy" ALL THE TIME.
- I experience bruxism (teeth clenching) at night.
- I sometimes experience pre-bedtime palpitations.
- I have tinnitus and itching scalp.
- I'm not able to spend any time under hot water (on my head) or in the sun (for more than 10 minutes). Hot water leads to blisters on my head. Sun results in itchiness even though there is no indication on the skin.
- I have low Neutrophils (Absolute)? It was 1.2 for my last physical.
- I have a CRP of 1 (which is good; indicates low inflammation).
- My total cholesterol is 282 (very high). I'm now on Rosuvastatin.
- I have low HRV. It is often in the low 20s as measured by my Oura Ring. Oura calculates nighttime HRVÂ **using rMSSD**,
- My deep sleep is very limited (20 minutes is typical).
- Brain fog and memory issues (probably the result of poor sleep).
- I get [[hot flashes]] in the middle of the night usually around 4am. I have started to eat Oatmeal at night after dinner and this has made them better.
- I have cold extremities while camping even though my sleeping bag is warm. My feet are surprisingly cold to the touch.
- Recently, I got up three times. I actually got up four times. That's because right after the second time, I felt the need again. I got up and sat on the toilet for a while and tried to go. I was only able to produce a small amount of urine. This made me think at the time that my bladder has severe irratation and/or is sending false signals at times to my brain. 



During the day, I drink 6 x 14oz of plain water. As a result, I void probably a dozen times during the day. I have a full stream for 5 - 7 - 10 seconds and then a lessor stream for 2 or 3 seconds. I have no problems with flow. 

I have to get up 3 times per night. I wake up and feel pressure. It is very hard for me to go back to sleep if I don't void. If I do go back to sleep without voiding, I tend to wake up 30 minutes later. My volume is very low at night. Probably only a few oz.

I went on a walk at night after dinner. I got the urge almost immediately after leaving my house. I had strong urges almost the entire time. When I returned my full stream only lasted 5 seconds. So, it wasn't that my bladder was full. It was that my detrusor muscle was contracting. I leaked a few drops. At night when sleeping it feels a little different. Pressure.

Here are my other symptoms.

- My mind tends to be "busy" ALL THE TIME.
- I experience bruxism (teeth clenching) at night.
- My deep sleep is very limited (20 minutes is typical).
- I have low HRV. It is often in the low 20s as messured by my Oura Ring. Oura calculates nighttime HRVÂ **using rMSSD**,
- My total cholesterol is 282 (very high). I'm now on Rosuvastatin.
- I sometimes experience pre-bedtime palpitations.
- I have tinnitus all the time.
- I'm not able to spend any time under hot water (on my head) or in the sun (for more than 10 minutes). Hot water leads to blisters on my head. Sun results in itchiness even though there is no indication on the skin.
