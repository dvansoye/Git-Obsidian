Activation Energy is the minimum energy required to initiate a process of transformation. It represents an initial barrier or "hump" that must be overcome for a change to occur, even if the change is ultimately favorable. The higher the activation energy, the more difficult it is to start the process.

- [[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]] - The initial mental effort required to start a task or form a new habit. Procrastination often occurs when a task has a high perceived activation energy. Breaking the task into smaller steps is a strategy to lower this barrier.
    
- [[Business Administration & Management]] - The upfront investment of resources (money, effort, political capital) needed to launch a new project or overcome organizational inertia. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) strategy is designed to lower the activation energy for market entry.
    
- [[Education Systems & Pedagogy]] - The initial cognitive difficulty and frustration faced when learning a new, complex skill. Effective teaching often involves scaffolding and breaking down material to lower the activation energy for students.
    
- [[Technology]] - The collective effort and shift in behavior required for society to adopt a new technology. Innovations with low activation energy for adoption (easy to integrate, low cost) tend to spread more rapidly.
