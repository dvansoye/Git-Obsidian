The Agency Problem is a conflict of interest that arises when one party (the "agent") is expected to act in the best interests of another party (the "principal"), but has an incentive to act in their own self-interest instead. This is particularly dangerous when the agent has more information than the principal and does not have Skin in the Gameâ€”they can reap rewards for advice or actions while the principal bears the risk of any negative consequences.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: The classic agency problem is between a company's management (agents) and its stockholders (principals). Management might pursue vanity projects or excessive executive pay that benefit them personally but harm shareholder value.
    
- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: A financial advisor (agent) who earns a commission for selling a particular product has an incentive to recommend that product to a client (principal), even if it is not the best investment for the client's needs.
    
- **[[Public Policy Analysis]]**: A politician (agent) might vote for a policy that benefits a major campaign donor (their own interest) rather than the general public they are supposed to represent (the principal).
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: A doctor (agent) who owns a stake in a laboratory has an incentive to order more tests for their patients (principals) than are medically necessary, as they profit from the referrals.
