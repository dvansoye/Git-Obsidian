Antifragility is the property of systems that thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors. It is beyond resilience or robustness; the resilient resists shocks and stays the same, while the antifragile gets better.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Biology]]**: The human immune system becomes stronger after being exposed to pathogens. Weightlifting is another example; muscles tear and rebuild stronger in response to the stress of lifting weights.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A decentralized corporate structure with autonomous teams can be antifragile. A failure in one team provides valuable lessons for the entire organization without sinking the ship, making the company as a whole more robust and adaptable.
    
- **[[Ecology & Biodiversity]]**: Forest ecosystems that experience periodic small fires are more resilient to major conflagrations. These small stressors clear out underbrush and weak trees, preventing the buildup of fuel that could lead to a catastrophic fire.
    
- **[[Investments & Asset Management]]**: A venture capital portfolio is designed to be antifragile. It accepts a high number of small losses (startup failures) in exchange for exposure to massive, disproportionate gains from a few successful companies (a positive Black Swan event).
