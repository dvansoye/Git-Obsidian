This model presents a spectrum of strategic approaches for defeating an opponent. **Attrition** is a direct approach focused on physically grinding down an adversary's resources and capacity to fight, favoring the side with superior numbers. **Maneuver** is an indirect approach that seeks to psychologically shatter the opponent's will and cohesion by using speed, surprise, and attacks on critical vulnerabilities to render them ineffective.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Strategic Management]]**: **Attrition** is a price war or a direct market share battle, like the "cola wars." **Maneuver** is disruptive innovation, where a company like Apple with the iPhone didn't compete on existing metrics but changed the entire basis of competition, making the incumbent's strengths irrelevant.
    
- **[[Law & Jurisprudence]]**: A legal team can use **attrition** by overwhelming the opposition with procedural motions to exhaust their financial resources. A **maneuver** approach would be introducing an unexpected legal theory that dislocates the opponent's entire case with a single, decisive action.
    
- **[[Politics]]**: An **attrition**-based political campaign focuses on outspending the opponent on advertising. A **maneuver** campaign might use a surprising policy announcement or a targeted message to a key demographic to reshape the political landscape and make the opponent's talking points obsolete.
