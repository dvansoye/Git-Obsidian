This model prioritizes long-term survival over short-term profit maximization. It is a set of rules for managing capital and sizing bets relative to one's total resources to ensure that one can withstand the inevitable, unpredictable swings of variance (luck). The core insight is that even a strategy with a positive expected value will lead to ruin if bet sizes are too large, as a statistically possible losing streak can wipe out one's capital.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Investments & Asset Management]]**: "Position sizing" is the investment equivalent. An investor may be correct about a stock, but over-leveraging or concentrating too heavily can lead to a total loss during a market downturn before the thesis can play out. The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula for optimizing position size to maximize long-term growth while avoiding ruin.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: For a startup, the "bankroll" is its runway of available capital. Managing the "burn rate" is a direct application of this model, ensuring the company does not run out of money before achieving profitability. For a large corporation, it means avoiding any single bet that could bankrupt the firm.
    
- **[[Personal Finance]]**: This model dictates the importance of an emergency fund and avoiding over-leveraging with debt. It ensures that an unexpected event, like a job loss or a medical emergency, does not lead to financial ruin, allowing for long-term financial stability and growth.
