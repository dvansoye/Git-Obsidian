The Barbell Strategy is a method for managing risk and positioning for upside by concentrating resources on two extremes while avoiding the "safe" middle. It involves being hyper-conservative with the majority of your resources and hyper-aggressive with a small minority, creating a portfolio that is robust to negative Black Swans while being exposed to positive ones.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Investments & Asset Management]]**: An investor might put 90% of their capital in extremely safe assets like Treasury bills (protecting them from a market crash) and 10% in highly speculative investments like cryptocurrencies or startup equity (exposing them to massive upside). This is contrasted with putting 100% in "medium-risk" stocks, which are vulnerable to both miscalculation and Black Swans.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A company could dedicate 90% of its resources to maintaining and incrementally improving its reliable, profitable core product, while dedicating 10% to a "skunkworks" division that experiments with radical, high-risk innovations.
    
- **[[Productivity]]**: An individual could structure their work life by having a very stable and predictable "day job" (the safe side of the barbell) while pursuing a high-risk, high-reward creative passion project in their free time (the speculative side).
    
- **[[Physical & Occupational Therapy]]**: A fitness regimen could be structured as a barbell, combining low-intensity, safe activities like walking (done frequently) with very high-intensity, short-duration activities like sprinting or heavy weightlifting (done infrequently), while avoiding moderate-intensity "chronic cardio."
