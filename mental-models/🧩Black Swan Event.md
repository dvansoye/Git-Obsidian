A Black Swan Event is a rare, high-impact, and unpredictable occurrence that is beyond the realm of normal expectations. In retrospect, however, people concoct explanations for it, making it seem predictable and explainable.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Geopolitics]]**: The 9/11 terrorist attacks were a classic Black Swan. They were statistically improbable, had an enormous global impact, and in hindsight, were rationalized as a predictable outcome of historical grievances.
    
- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: The 2008 financial crisis was a Black Swan for most economic models. The complex derivatives and interconnectedness of banks created a fragile system, and the subsequent collapse had an extreme global impact that few predicted.
    
- **[[Technology]]**: The rapid rise and dominance of the internet was a positive Black Swan. It was an outlier that transformed society, commerce, and communication in ways that were almost impossible to forecast in the 1980s.
    
- **[[History]]**: The outbreak of World War I is often considered a Black Swan. A single event (the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand) triggered a cascade of events that led to a global conflict of unprecedented scale and impact, which few could have foreseen.
