Based on Archimedes' Principle, this model states that a body immersed in a fluid is supported by a force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. It demonstrates that an entity's ability to "float" within a system is determined not by its own intrinsic weight alone, but by its relationship with the surrounding environment and its ability to displace a supportive medium.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Economic Theory]]**: A market can be seen as a fluid of purchasing power. An asset's price is "buoyed" by demand. If a large new supply of stock (the "weight") is issued, it must "displace" an equivalent amount of capital to be absorbed without sinking the price. Price support mechanisms from a central bank act like a dense fluid, increasing the "buoyant force".
    
- **[[Sociology & Social Structures]]**: A community is a social "fluid." Newcomers "float" and integrate successfully if their collective needs (their "weight") are equal to or less than the society's supportive capacity (the "buoyant force"). Successful integration depends as much on the "density" of the host society's support systems as on the newcomers themselves.
    
- **[[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]]**: An individual's mental and emotional capacity is a "fluid" providing buoyancy. Our tasks and stressors are the "weight." When we are rested and supported, our internal fluid is "dense" and we can handle a heavy load. When we are fatigued, even a small stressor can feel heavy enough to "sink" us into a state of being overwhelmed.
