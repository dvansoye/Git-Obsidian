Calculated Duality is a mental model describing the strategic use of sharp contrasts between public statements and private actions to appeal to multiple, often contradictory, audiences simultaneously. The public persona is a calculated tool used to placate one group while private actions advance the goals of another.

[[Public Relations]] - A corporation publicly champions environmental causes while privately lobbying against stricter environmental regulations.

[[Diplomacy & Conflict Resolution]] - A diplomat makes reassuring public statements to de-escalate tensions while privately preparing for an aggressive negotiation.

[[Intelligence & Counterterrorism]] - An intelligence officer uses compartmentalization and code-switching to manage different identities, preventing information from leaking between them and allowing them to operate in multiple worlds at once.
