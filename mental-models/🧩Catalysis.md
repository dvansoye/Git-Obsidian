Catalysis is the process where a substance or agent (a catalyst) accelerates the rate of a transformation without being consumed in the process. It works by providing an alternative, lower-energy pathway, effectively reducing the "Activation Energy" required for the change to happen.

- [[Business Administration & Management]] - An "innovation catalyst" (e.g., a specific person, new technology, or methodology like Agile) can dramatically speed up an organization's ability to change or develop new products by lowering the internal barriers to action.
    
- [[Sociology & Social Structures]] - A pivotal event (e.g., a crisis) or a transformative invention (e.g., the printing press) can act as a catalyst for profound and rapid social change, accelerating shifts in norms and structures that would otherwise take much longer.
    
- [[Organizational Behavior & HRM]] - "Catalytic leadership" is a style where the leader's role is not to command, but to empower and enable the team, removing obstacles and lowering the activation energy for collaboration and initiative.
    
- [[Interpersonal Relationships]] - A key person (like a mentor) or a significant life event (like a personal crisis) can act as a catalyst for rapid personal growth by providing new perspectives or urgency that lowers the internal resistance to change.
