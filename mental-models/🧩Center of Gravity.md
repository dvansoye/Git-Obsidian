The Center of Gravity (CoG) is the primary source of an entity's strength, cohesion, and will to actâ€”"the hub of all power and movement, on which everything depends". The strategic imperative is to identify this core element within any system and focus effort against it, as a blow to the CoG will have a disproportionate, cascading, and decisive effect.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A competitor's CoG is the true source of their advantage. It might not be a specific product but their brand reputation, distribution network, or unique culture. Attacking Microsoft's CoG wasn't building a better word processor, but creating new platforms (like mobile operating systems) that made their PC operating system monopoly less relevant.
    
- **[[Systems Thinking]]**: In any complex system, the CoG is the node or process with the highest leverage. In an economic crisis, the CoG might not be unemployment (a symptom) but consumer confidence (the core driver of spending). Interventions should target confidence to have the greatest effect.
    
- **[[Supply Chain & Logistics]]**: The "Center of Gravity Method" is a literal application used to find the optimal geographic location for a distribution center by calculating the point that minimizes transportation costs for the entire network.
