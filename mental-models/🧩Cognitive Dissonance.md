The mental discomfort experienced by a person who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs.

[[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]] - People will often rationalize or justify poor decisions to reduce this discomfort (e.g., "sour grapes").

[[Attitudes & Persuasion]] - Creating a state of dissonance can make someone more open to changing their mind to resolve the conflict.
