Confirmation Bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is a form of cognitive bias and a systematic error of inductive reasoning, causing us to get locked into our current way of thinking.

[[Organizational Behavior & HRM]] - A manager who believes an employee is a "low-performer" will subconsciously look for evidence confirming that belief (e.g., focusing on a minor mistake) while ignoring evidence of good performance. This can lead to unfair evaluations and demotivated teams.

[[Judgment & Decision-Making]] - When researching a major purchase or decision (like buying a car), people often make an initial emotional choice and then seek out articles and reviews that justify that choice, rather than conducting an objective search for the best option.

[[Public Policy Analysis]] - Policymakers with a strong ideological belief may favor data and studies that support their preferred policies while dismissing or discrediting research that contradicts them, leading to ineffective or harmful governance.
