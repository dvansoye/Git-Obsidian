This is a survival-critical mental model for assessing risk in a hazardous environment by distinguishing between two types of protection. **Cover** is physical protection that stops a threat. **Concealment** is protection from observation only and does not stop the threat. In any high-stakes environment, one must not mistake concealment for cover.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: A well-diversified portfolio of uncorrelated assets provides **cover** from a market crash in one sector. A portfolio of highly correlated tech stocks that has simply performed well in a bull market provides only **concealment**; it looks safe but offers no real protection in a downturn.
    
- **[[Cybersecurity]]**: A firewall provides a degree of **cover** by actively blocking malicious traffic. Using a VPN provides **concealment** by hiding your IP address, but it does not stop you from downloading a virus.
    
- **[[Public Health]]**: During a pandemic, a vaccine provides biological **cover** by training the immune system to fight the virus. A simple cloth mask provides a degree of **concealment** by hiding the wearer from some viral particles, but it does not provide the same level of protection as an N95 respirator or a vaccine.
