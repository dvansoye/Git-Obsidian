Dead Reckoning is a process of calculating a current position based on a previously known position, speed, and direction. It is a model for navigating in the absence of external references, but it is inherently subject to cumulative error. The core insight is the necessity of acting on the best available information while being constantly aware of its potential inaccuracy and actively seeking external "fixes" to correct for the inevitable drift.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: A company's financial forecast is a form of dead reckoning. It starts from a known position (last quarter's results) and projects forward based on assumptions. A prudent manager treats this forecast as an estimate that must be constantly updated with actual results (new "fixes") to correct for drift.
    
- **[[Strategic Management]]**: A corporate strategic plan is a dead reckoning course. The plan itself is a hypothesis about the future, subject to the cumulative errors of flawed assumptions. The value is not in the initial plan but in the rigor of the process used to update and correct it with regular "fixes" like quarterly business reviews.
    
- **[[Philosophy]]**: The interplay between rationalism (deducing from prior principles) and empiricism (observing external reality) mirrors dead reckoning. We build theories based on what we know (our DR plot), but must constantly test them against new evidence (a "fix") to correct for the drift of our assumptions. This model teaches a form of intellectual humility, requiring us to act while acknowledging the limitations of our knowledge.
