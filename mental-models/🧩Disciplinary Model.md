In-Domain Definition: The Disciplinary Model describes a form of power that operates not through overt force but through subtle, pervasive systems of surveillance, normalization, and examination. Its goal is to create "docile and useful bodies"â€”subjects who internalize the scrutinizing gaze and regulate their own behavior to conform to established norms. The ultimate metaphor is the Panopticon, a prison design where inmates, never knowing if they are being watched, become their own overseers.

[[Technology]] - Social media platforms function as a "digital Panopticon" where users voluntarily subject themselves to the constant gaze of an unknown audience. The fear of criticism and the desire for affirmation ("likes") act as "normalizing judgments," encouraging users to perform and curate an idealized online persona. This is a form of self-regulation driven not by fear of punishment, but by the desire for social validation.

[[Business Administration & Management]] - The modern workplace uses electronic performance monitoring, video cameras, and analysis of internal communications as panoptic tools. The mere perception of being watched is enough to influence employee conduct. This culminates in the "algopticon," where algorithms provide continuous, automated oversight, ranking and scoring workers in a way that appears objective but is a direct exercise of disciplinary power.

[[Education Systems & Pedagogy]] - The traditional classroom, with its rows of desks facing a teacher, is a panoptic architecture that facilitates hierarchical observation. Standardized testing functions as the "examination," a disciplinary technique that renders each student's knowledge visible, ranks them against a norm, and transforms them into a manageable "case" for administrators and policymakers.
