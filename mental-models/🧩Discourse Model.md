In-Domain Definition: The Discourse Model posits that reality is constructed through regulated systems of statements, practices, and institutions that "systematically form the objects of which they speak." A discourse is not a neutral window onto reality but the very framework that makes reality intelligible, setting the unwritten rules for what can be said, who has authority to speak, and what is considered a valid question or a true answer.

[[Law & Jurisprudence]] - The concept of "intellectual property" is not a timeless truth but a historically specific discourse. The shift from viewing patents as a "liberty-intruding privilege" to a natural "property right" has had profound effects, prioritizing corporate interests over the public domain. Legal language and procedures are the mechanisms through which this discourse operates, creating and reinforcing a specific power structure.

[[Education Systems & Pedagogy]] - The field of education is governed by powerful discourses that shape the identities of teachers and students. The discourse of "accountability," with its focus on standardized testing, produces the "data-driven" teacher and the "at-risk" student, establishing a "regime of truth" about what constitutes good teaching and successful learning.

[[Business Administration & Management]] - Corporate culture is a discursive formation. Mission statements, value propositions, and management jargon are not decorative; they are a discourse that shapes how employees think and relate to their work. The language of "teamwork" and "innovation" masks the underlying power relations of the employment contract by reframing them as a shared mission.
