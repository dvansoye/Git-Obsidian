Domain Dependence is the human tendency to be unable to recognize and apply knowledge or a concept in a new context or domain, even if it is fundamentally the same as one they understand in another. Our knowledge often becomes "trapped" in the specific context in which it was learned.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Judgment & Decision-Making]]**: A doctor might be brilliant at diagnosing medical problems but fall for simple financial scams. They are unable to transfer their skills of critical thinking and evidence-based analysis from the medical domain to the financial domain.
    
- **[[Education Systems & Pedagogy]]**: A student can solve a complex math problem in a textbook but is unable to apply the same mathematical principles to a real-world problem, like calculating the compound interest on a loan. Their knowledge is dependent on the academic domain.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: An executive who is a master of logistics in a manufacturing company may be completely lost when trying to organize a complex social event. The underlying principles of planning and resource allocation are the same, but their skills are trapped in the business domain.
    
- **[[Sports & Athletics]]**: A chess grandmaster who can think dozens of moves ahead in a game might make impulsive and short-sighted decisions in their personal life. Their strategic thinking is domain-dependent.
