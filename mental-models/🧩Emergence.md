Emergence is the phenomenon where high-level properties and behaviors arise from the interactions of low-level components, but are not simply reducible to or deducible from the properties of those components. These emergent phenomena, like life, thought, and culture, have a quasi-autonomous existence and require their own level of explanation. The world cannot be understood by reductionism alone.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Biology]]**: Life itself is an emergent phenomenon. A living organism is made of non-living atoms (carbon, oxygen, etc.), but the property of "life" cannot be understood by studying those atoms in isolation. It emerges from the complex organization and interaction of those atoms.
    
- **[[Neuroscience]]**: Consciousness is an emergent property of the brain. While it is rooted in the interactions of billions of neurons, the subjective experience of "I" cannot be found by examining a single neuron. It is a property of the system as a whole.
    
- **[[Economic Theory]]**: Market prices are an emergent phenomenon. They arise from the individual buying and selling decisions of millions of people, yet the overall price level is a property of the market as a whole and cannot be predicted by analyzing any single individual's motivations.
