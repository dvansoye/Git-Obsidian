In an isolated system, entropy (disorder) tends to increase over time. Systems naturally move from order to disorder unless energy is put in to maintain them.

[[Organizational Behavior & HRM]] - Without constant effort, leadership, and clear processes, companies and teams tend to become disorganized and inefficient.

[[Interpersonal Relationships]] - Personal and professional relationships require ongoing effort and communication to thrive; neglect leads to decay.

[[Education Systems & Pedagogy]] - Knowledge and skills atrophy over time if not actively maintained and practiced.
