Ergodicity is a concept from statistical mechanics that has profound implications for risk. A process is "ergodic" if the average of all possible outcomes at a given moment is the same as the average outcome of a single path over time. A process is "non-ergodic" if these two are different. The key insight is that many real-world risks are non-ergodic because they contain an "absorbing barrier"â€”a point of no return, like death or bankruptcy. For a group of 100 people playing Russian Roulette once, the expected outcome is a large profit, but for one person playing 100 times, the expected outcome is certain death. You cannot use group probabilities to analyze risks that can take you out of the game permanently.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Investments & Asset Management]]**: A hedge fund with 100 traders can afford to have a few "blow up" (a group average). An individual investor cannot; a single catastrophic loss can wipe them out forever (a time average). This means an individual's strategy must prioritize survival above all else, a principle often missed by models based on market averages.
    
- **[[Public Health]]**: The risk of smoking is non-ergodic. While a single cigarette is harmless, the cumulative effect over time can lead to a terminal illness (an absorbing barrier). You cannot average the risk over a population to determine your personal risk if you are the one who gets cancer.
    
- **[[Entrepreneurship]]**: Viewing entrepreneurship from a societal perspective, it's good that many startups fail, as it leads to innovation (an ergodic, group view). For the individual founder, however, going into massive personal debt to fund a startup is a non-ergodic risk, as bankruptcy can be an absorbing state from which it is very difficult to recover.
    
- **[[Sports & Athletics]]**: The risk of dying in an extreme sport is low on any given day. However, for someone who engages in the sport repeatedly over many years, the cumulative probability of a fatal accident approaches certainty. The path is non-ergodic; you cannot be "a little bit dead."
