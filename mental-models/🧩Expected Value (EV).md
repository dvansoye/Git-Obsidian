Expected Value (EV) is the foundational calculus for rational decision-making under uncertainty. It represents the probability-weighted average of all possible outcomes for a given choice, answering the question: "If I made this decision an infinite number of times, what would the average outcome be?" The core discipline is to consistently make decisions with a positive expected value (+EV), irrespective of the short-term result of any single event.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: The investment philosophy of Warren Buffett is a direct application of EV. He seeks to purchase assets where the probability of gain multiplied by the amount of potential gain is greater than the probability of loss multiplied by the amount of potential loss. This provides a rational framework for capital allocation.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: When deciding between competing projects, a manager uses EV thinking to allocate scarce resources. By estimating the probabilities and potential payoffs of each initiative (e.g., a new market entry vs. an R&D project), they can prioritize the options with the highest long-term potential payoff.
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: A doctor choosing a treatment plan implicitly weighs the expected value. They consider the probability of a treatment's success and the value of that success (e.g., full recovery) against the probability of side effects and their negative value (harm to the patient), aiming for the course of action with the highest positive expected outcome for the patient's health.
