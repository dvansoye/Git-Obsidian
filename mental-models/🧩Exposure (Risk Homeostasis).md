Exposure is the visceral, psychological awareness of the severe consequences of a potential failure. This model illustrates the theory of **Risk Homeostasis**: humans have a target level of risk they are comfortable with and will adjust their behavior to maintain it. In a high-exposure environment (where consequences are severe), behavior becomes more cautious and deliberate. In a low-exposure environment (where consequences are mitigated), behavior can become more reckless.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]]**: A driver on an icy road (**high exposure**) will slow down and increase their following distance. The same driver in a modern car with airbags and anti-lock brakes (**low exposure**) might be more inclined to speed or follow closely, a phenomenon known as risk compensation.
    
- **[[Organizational Behavior & HRM]]**: This model provides a counterpoint to "psychological safety." A team trying to innovate needs a **low-exposure** environment where they feel safe to fail. A team performing heart surgery needs a **high-exposure** culture where the severe consequences of failure enforce rigorous adherence to procedure and eliminate error.
    
- **[[Economic Theory]]**: **Moral hazard** is a state of zero personal exposure. Financial institutions in the 2008 crisis took on excessive risk with the implicit understanding that they were "too big to fail" and would be bailed out, decoupling their actions from the consequences. A mountaineer, by contrast, has total ownership of their risk, forcing a higher degree of prudence.
