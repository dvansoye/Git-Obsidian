**Abstract Principle:** An externality is an unintended side effect of a commercial activity that affects other parties without this effect being reflected in the market price. These spillover effects can be negative (imposing a cost on others) or positive (conferring a benefit). Because the full social costs or benefits are not accounted for, externalities are a classic form of market failure.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **Environmental Policy & Law:** A factory that pollutes a river creates a negative externality. It imposes a cost (polluted water) on downstream communities, but this cost is not part of its production expenses. A government can "internalize" this externality by imposing a Pigouvian tax on the pollution, forcing the factory to account for the societal damage.
    
- **Technology:** Social media platforms create positive network externalities. Each new user who joins makes the platform slightly more valuable for all existing users. This creates a powerful feedback loop that drives growth. However, they can also produce negative externalities, like the spread of misinformation, which imposes a social cost not borne by the platform or the user sharing the content.
    
- **Public Health:** Vaccinations are a prime example of a positive externality. An individual who gets vaccinated receives a private benefit (protection from disease), but also confers a benefit to the entire community by reducing the risk of transmission to others, contributing to herd immunity.
