All human knowledge is conjectural and subject to error. There are no authoritative sources of knowledge, nor any reliable means of justifying ideas as certainly true or probable. The recognition of our own fallibility is the essential precondition for the growth of knowledge, as it forces us to adopt a tradition of criticism and error-correction rather than clinging to dogma.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Epistemology & Logic]]**: The scientific method is a formal system built on fallibilism. It institutionalizes the process of conjecture and refutation, where even the most cherished theories are constantly subjected to criticism and experimental tests in the search for errors.
    
- **[[Social & Political Philosophy]]**: A healthy democratic system is an expression of fallibilism. It provides mechanisms for the peaceful removal of bad leaders and the repeal of bad policies, acknowledging that political decisions are fallible and require a process for correction. In contrast, totalitarian systems are based on the premise of infallible leaders or ideologies.
    
- **[[Judgment & Decision-Making]]**: A fallibilist mindset in personal life involves being open to the possibility that your most deeply held beliefs might be wrong. This intellectual humility allows you to learn from mistakes, update your views in the face of better explanations, and avoid the trap of dogmatism.
