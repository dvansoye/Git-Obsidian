Fire and Maneuver is a model for competitive action where two distinct but symbiotic efforts are used to defeat an opponent. One element (Fire) fixes the adversary's attention and resources, suppressing their ability to react. This creates the tactical and psychological opportunity for the other element (Maneuver) to move to a position of decisive advantage to win.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A company can use an aggressive marketing campaign and price cuts for an existing product as its "base of fire" to fix its competitors' attention. While they are busy responding, the company can "maneuver" by launching a disruptive new product in an adjacent market.
    
- **[[Law & Jurisprudence]]**: In a courtroom, a lawyer might use a relentless line of questioning on a secondary point (fire) to distract and fluster an opposing witness, creating an opening to introduce a critical piece of evidence or land a decisive question on the main issue (maneuver).
    
- **[[Sports & Athletics]]**: In soccer, one player can make a distracting run down the wing (fire), drawing defenders toward them. This creates open space in the center of the field for the star striker to receive a pass and score (maneuver).
