This model describes two inherent and unavoidable conditions of any complex real-world endeavor. **Fog** is the uncertainty and ambiguity caused by incomplete or inaccurate information. **Friction** is the accumulation of countless small, unpredictable impedimentsâ€”from equipment failure to human errorâ€”that makes even simple tasks difficult to execute. These are not problems to be eliminated but permanent features of reality that must be navigated.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Operations Management]]**: In project management, **Fog** is the ambiguity in initial requirements, while **Friction** is the unexpected software bug or the key team member who resigns. Agile methodologies are designed to cope with Fog & Friction by favoring iteration and flexibility over rigid long-term plans.
    
- **[[Entrepreneurship]]**: A startup operates in a dense **Fog** of market uncertainty and under immense **Friction** from resource constraints. The entrepreneurial mindset doesn't wait for the fog to clear but uses rapid experimentation to probe the uncertainty and find a path forward.
    
- **[[Organizational Design]]**: Because Fog and Friction are a "tax" on complexity, the most resilient organizations favor simplicity and decentralized execution ("mission command"). This allows local adaptation to Friction without being paralyzed by a centralized decision process that is blinded by Fog.
