The boundaries we place around a problem, a choice, a dataset, or a narrative fundamentally control its interpretation and the subsequent decisions made. What is left outside the frame is implicitly, and often invisibly, defined as irrelevant. This act of defining the boundaries of consideration is often more powerful than the subsequent analysis that takes place within those boundaries. To control the frame is to control the conversation, the decision, and ultimately, the perception of reality itself.

**Concrete Applications:**

- [[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]]: The **"Framing Effect"** demonstrates that people react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented or "framed". For example, a choice framed in terms of gains (saving 200 people) is preferred over the identical choice framed in terms of losses (400 people dying).
    
- [[Business Administration & Management]]: **Problem framing** is a critical discipline that posits that the most common cause of strategic failure is not the inability to solve a problem, but the tendency to solve the wrong problem. It involves defining the boundaries of a challenge before attempting to solve it.
    
- [[Political Science & Systems]]: **Narrative framing** in political discourse uses specific language to activate a conceptual framework in the listener's mind. For instance, "tax relief" frames taxation as an affliction, whereas "tax cuts for the wealthy" frames the same policy as a benefit for a select few.
