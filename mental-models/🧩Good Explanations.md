A "Good Explanation" is one that is hard to vary while still accounting for what it purports to explain. Its details are functional and cannot be easily changed without destroying the explanation's logic. This criterion distinguishes genuinely deep, explanatory knowledge from mere descriptions, rules of thumb, or prophecies, which can be easily modified to fit any outcome. Good explanations have "reach"â€”they solve problems beyond the ones they were created for.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Philosophy of Science]]**: The explanation for the seasons is that the Earth's axis is tilted. This is a good explanation because every detailâ€”the tilt, the orbit, the nature of radiant heatâ€”is critical. You cannot easily change any part of it and still explain why summer in the northern hemisphere coincides with winter in the southern. In contrast, the explanation "the gods did it" is a bad explanation because it can be varied infinitely to explain anything.
    
- **[[Strategic Management]]**: A company's strategy should be a good explanation for its success. If a strategy consists of vague platitudes like "we will leverage synergies to maximize shareholder value," it is a bad explanation, easily varied and applicable to any company. A good strategic explanation, like "we will dominate the market by building a proprietary, low-cost manufacturing process," is hard to vary and provides a clear, testable theory of the business.
    
- **[[Judgment & Decision-Making]]**: When evaluating an argument or proposal, the "hardness to vary" criterion is a powerful tool for detecting flawed reasoning. If a person's justification for a decision can be easily adapted to support the opposite decision, it is not a good explanation and should be treated with skepticism.
