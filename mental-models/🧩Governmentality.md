In-Domain Definition: Governmentality, or the "conduct of conduct," is a form of power that operates by shaping and guiding the choices of free subjects. It works through the freedom of the individual, not against it. Under neoliberal governmentality, every individual is encouraged to become an "entrepreneur of the self," responsible for managing their own skills, health, and well-being to maximize their value in a competitive market.

[[Business Administration & Management]] - Corporate wellness programs are a key technique of governmentality. They don't mandate health behaviors by force but create an environment of incentives that encourages employees to voluntarily take responsibility for maintaining their own fitness and productivity, aligning personal desires with corporate objectives.

[[Political Economy]] - Neoliberalism extends market logic to all spheres of life. The state's role shifts from providing welfare to creating a framework where individuals must compete. Social problems like unemployment are reframed as the result of poor individual choices, shifting responsibility from the system to the self-governing citizen.

[[Technology]] - "Surveillance capitalism" is a new form of governmentality that uses a "means of behavioral modification." By collecting vast amounts of behavioral data, tech companies subtly manipulate the choice architecture of digital environments to "tune, herd, and condition" user behavior toward profitable outcomes, often without conscious awareness.
