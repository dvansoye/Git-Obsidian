Iatrogenics refers to harm caused by the healer, physician, or interventionist. It describes situations where an attempt to solve a problem ends up causing a worse one, often due to a failure to appreciate the complexity of the system being tinkered with and the potential for unintended second-order effects.

Note: Etymology: From Greek iatros (healer/physician) + genesis (origin). Literally: ‚Äúbrought forth by the healer.‚Äù

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: The overuse of antibiotics is a prime example. While intended to cure infections, it can lead to the creation of antibiotic-resistant "superbugs," a far greater long-term threat. Similarly, unnecessary surgeries or medications can cause harm that outweighs the potential benefit.
    
- **[[Foreign Policy Analysis]]**: Military interventions designed to stabilize a region can create a power vacuum, leading to civil war and the rise of extremist groups‚Äîa form of geopolitical iatrogenics. The intervention to remove a dictator (the problem) results in a failed state (a much worse problem).
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A manager who intervenes too frequently in their team's work can stifle creativity, reduce autonomy, and ultimately lower performance. The "help" they provide is iatrogenic, causing more harm than good.
    
- **[[Environmental Policy & Law]]**: The policy of aggressively suppressing all forest fires was an iatrogenic intervention. It was intended to protect forests but led to the buildup of deadwood, resulting in larger, more destructive fires than would have occurred naturally.
