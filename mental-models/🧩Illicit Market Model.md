The Illicit Market Model posits that prohibiting a good or service for which there is high demand does not eliminate the market but transforms it. Illegality acts as a "risk tax" that dramatically inflates prices and profits, creating a powerful incentive for criminal enterprises to supply the demand. The state's own enforcement actions become a primary driver of the market's profitability and structure.

- [[Public Policy Analysis]] - The American Prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s is a classic example. The policy failed to stop consumption but instead created the highly profitable black market that fueled the rise of powerful organized crime syndicates.
    
- [[Finance, Banking & Investment]] - Venture capital operates on a similar principle of risk premium. Investors demand the potential for exceptionally high returns to compensate for the high probability of failure in early-stage startups, much like criminals demand high profits for the risk of arrest.
    
- [[Technology]] - The "balloon effect" is visible in cybersecurity when law enforcement shuts down a major darknet market. The action doesn't end the trade; it displaces it, leading to the creation of numerous smaller, more resilient, and more secure markets that are harder to track.
    
- [[Environmental Policy & Law]] - The illegal trade in endangered species or banned substances like ivory and rhino horn is driven by this model. The high risk of poaching and trafficking, created by international bans, leads to extremely high prices on the black market, which in turn incentivizes more poaching.
