The Indirect Approach is the principle of avoiding an opponent's concentrated strength and instead attacking their weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and perceptions to achieve a disproportionate psychological and physical dislocation. Rather than engaging in a costly, strength-on-strength confrontation, it seeks to break the enemy's resistance without fighting directly.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Technology]]**: Clayton Christensen's theory of **Disruptive Innovation** is a perfect analogue. A disruptor doesn't attack the market leader at the high end but introduces a "good enough" product at the low end, a weakness the incumbent is incentivized to ignore. This allows the disruptor to gain a foothold and eventually displace the established player.
    
- **[[Marketing]]**: A "flanking attack" is a marketing strategy where a company avoids a direct fight with a market leader by targeting an uncontested geographic area or an underserved customer segment where the competitor is weak.
    
- **[[Biology]]**: Batesian mimicry is a form of deception where a harmless species evolves to resemble a dangerous one. This is an indirect survival strategy that attacks the predator's perception and decision-making process rather than engaging in a physical confrontation.
