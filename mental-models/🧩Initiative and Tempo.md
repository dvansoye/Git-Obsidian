Initiative and Tempo is a model for weaponizing time to control the flow of a competitive interaction. A "tempo" is a single unit of action (a move). By making moves that serve a dual purposeâ€”improving one's own position while forcing the opponent to reactâ€”a player gains tempi and seizes the "initiative." The player with the initiative dictates the narrative of the conflict, forcing the opponent into a defensive, reactive posture from which they cannot execute their own plans.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A "first-mover advantage" is a business application of seizing the initiative. The first company to enter a market gets to set the industry standard, build brand recognition, and lock in customers, forcing all subsequent competitors to react to their established position. The theory of "time-based competition" argues that compressing the time required for key processes, like product development, is a primary strategic weapon.
    
- **[[Military Science & National Security]]**: Colonel John Boyd's [[ðŸ§©OODA Loop]] (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) is the military formalization of this concept. By cycling through the decision loop faster than an adversary, a force can maintain a high tempo of operations that disrupts the enemy's ability to orient to the changing situation, seizing the initiative and inducing strategic paralysis.
    
- **[[Productivity]]**: In personal productivity, gaining tempo means completing a high-leverage task early in the day. This creates momentum (initiative) and provides a psychological advantage, making subsequent tasks easier and preventing a reactive scramble to catch up later.
