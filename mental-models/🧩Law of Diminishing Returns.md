The principle that as you add more of one input to a system while keeping other inputs constant, the marginal benefit from each additional unit of input will eventually start to decrease.

[[Microeconomics]] - Adding more workers to a factory floor will increase output, but only up to a point. Eventually, workers will get in each other's way, and the increase in production per new worker will shrink.

[[Agricultural Sciences & Technology]] - Applying more fertilizer to a field increases crop yield, but each additional application results in a smaller yield increase than the last, and can eventually harm the soil and reduce yield.

[[Productivity]] - Studying for 10 hours straight may not be as effective as two focused 5-hour sessions. After a certain point, the amount of new information you retain for each extra hour of study decreases.
