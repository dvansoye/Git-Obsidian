Le Chatelier's Principle states that if a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will shift in a way that counteracts the stress to re-establish a new equilibrium. It is a fundamental model for understanding how dynamic systems maintain stability by actively resisting and adapting to external perturbations.

- [[Economic Theory]] - Market equilibrium responds to shocks. If a sudden increase in demand (a stress) occurs, prices will rise, which in turn incentivizes an increase in supply, thereby counteracting the initial stress and establishing a new, higher price equilibrium.
    
- [[Physiology]] - Homeostasis in the body is a biological application of this principle. For example, if body temperature rises (a stress), the body responds by sweating to cool down, a shift designed to counteract the heat and restore thermal equilibrium.
    
- [[Sociology & Social Structures]] - Social systems often resist change. When a new policy or social trend (a stress) is introduced, it can trigger counter-movements or adaptive behaviors within the society aimed at relieving the tension and restoring a sense of stability or a new status quo.
    
- [[Environmental Science & Management]] - When a pollutant (a stress) is introduced into an ecosystem, the system may shift to mitigate its impact. This could involve the proliferation of organisms that can break down the pollutant, altering the food web to adapt to the new conditions.
