The Levels of Conflict is a hierarchical model for dissecting any complex endeavor into distinct but interconnected levels of activity: tactical, operational, and strategic. The core idea is that tactical success (doing the job right) is meaningless unless it serves operational goals, which in turn must be aligned with the overall strategy (doing the right job) to achieve the ultimate objective.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A company's activities can be mapped to this hierarchy. The corporate mission is the **grand strategy**, the business model is the **strategy**, a product launch is an **operation**, and a specific marketing campaign is a **tactic**. A brilliant marketing campaign (tactical win) for a product nobody wants is a strategic failure.
    
- **[[Public Policy Analysis]]**: A government's **grand strategy** is its long-term vision for national security and prosperity. A specific law is a **tactic**. The law may be perfectly implemented (tactical success), but if it has unintended consequences that harm the economy, it represents a strategic failure.
    
- **[[Personal Development]]**: An individual's core values are their **grand strategy**. A five-year career plan is their **strategy**. A specific project at work is an **operation**, and the daily tasks to complete it are **tactics**. Being busy with daily tasks without a clear direction leads to tactical action without strategic progress.
