Levels of Thinking is a recursive model for analyzing strategic interactions by modeling the cognitive depth of one's opponents. A Level-1 thinker asks, "What does my opponent have?" A Level-2 thinker asks, "What does my opponent think _I_ have?" A Level-3 thinker asks, "What does my opponent think I think _they_ have?" The goal is not to be the highest-level thinker in an absolute sense, but to be precisely one level higher than the opponent to exploit their predictable patterns.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: In pricing strategy, a Level-1 company bases its price on its own costs. A Level-2 company sets its price based on what it expects a competitor to charge. A Level-3 company might set a price designed to send a specific signal to a competitor (e.g., a low price to deter market entry), based on what it thinks the competitor thinks about its own strategy.
    
- **[[Game Theory]]**: This model is used to explain behavior in strategic games that deviates from pure rationality. It predicts that people's strategic reasoning is bounded and that outcomes often cluster around the choices made by Level-1, Level-2, or Level-3 thinkers.
    
- **[[Politics]]**: Strategic communication in a political campaign is an exercise in multiple levels of thinking. A campaign anticipates the media's interpretation of a message, the opposing campaign's likely attack on that interpretation, and frames the initial message to preemptively neutralize that attack.
