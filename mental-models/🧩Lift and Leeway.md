Leeway is the unavoidable sideways drift that separates a vessel's intended course (heading) from its actual path (course over ground). It represents the persistent, often invisible, gap between intention and reality, a force that cannot be eliminated but must be anticipated, understood, and actively managed by aiming slightly off-target to achieve a goal.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: "Strategic drift" is the corporate version of leeway, where a company's strategic plan (the heading) diverges from its actual market trajectory (the course). This is caused by sideways forces like organizational inertia and market friction. Effective leaders must anticipate this drift by building in buffers and setting KPIs that are slightly more ambitious than the goal to compensate.
    
- **[[Personal Development]]**: The "intention-action gap" is a form of personal leeway, representing the daily drift from our goals caused by distraction, procrastination, and unforeseen events. To achieve a goal like writing a book, one must plan for this drift by setting a daily word count target higher than the bare minimum required, building in a buffer to account for unproductive days.
    
- **[[Sociology & Social Structures]]**: Government policies often experience "policy drift," where the original intent (the heading) is altered by the realities of implementation by "street-level bureaucrats." The actual outcome (the course over ground) can be very different. Effective governance requires anticipating this leeway through robust feedback mechanisms and clear guidance.
