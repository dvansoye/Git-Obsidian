The Lindy Effect posits that the future life expectancy of a non-perishable thingâ€”like a technology, an idea, or a cultural formâ€”is proportional to its current age. The longer something has survived, the longer it is likely to continue to survive, as it has demonstrated a fitness against the filtering process of time.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Technology]]**: Technologies like the wheel or the book have been around for millennia and are likely to persist in some form for a very long time. In contrast, a new, trendy social media app has a very low Lindy value and is likely to be replaced quickly. Bitcoin, having survived for over a decade, has a higher probability of surviving another decade than it did in its first year.
    
- **[[Arts & Humanities]]**: The works of Shakespeare or the Bible have survived for centuries, suggesting they contain timeless insights into the human condition and are likely to be read for centuries more. A modern bestseller, however, is statistically unlikely to be read in 100 years.
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: Traditional dietary practices that have existed for thousands of years (e.g., the Mediterranean diet) are more likely to be beneficial for human health than a new fad diet promoted by modern "experts".
    
- **[[Philosophy]]**: The philosophical ideas of the Stoics (like Seneca and Marcus Aurelius) have endured for over two millennia, indicating their robustness and applicability to the recurring challenges of human life.
