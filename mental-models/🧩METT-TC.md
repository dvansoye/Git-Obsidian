METT-TC (Mission, Enemy, Terrain & Weather, Troops & Support, Time, Civil Considerations) is a mnemonic that serves as a cognitive filing system for systematically analyzing a complex situation. It provides a structured framework that forces a leader to consider all critical variables and their interplay, transforming a chaotic stream of raw data into a coherent understanding of the operational environment.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Strategic Management]]**: A SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a business analogue. It provides a framework for a company to analyze its internal state (Troops) and the external environment (Enemy, Terrain) to inform its strategy (Mission).
    
- **[[Investments & Asset Management]]**: An investor analyzing a potential stock purchase might use a METT-TC-like framework: **M**ission (investment goal), **E**nemy (competitors, market risks), **T**errain (the macroeconomic environment), **T**roops (their available capital), **T**ime (their investment horizon), **C**ivil (regulatory and political factors).
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: When diagnosing a patient, a doctor uses a systematic approach, considering the **M**ission (treating the illness), **E**nemy (the pathogen or condition), **T**errain (the patient's overall health and genetics), **T**roops (available medications and therapies), **T**ime (the urgency of the condition), and **C**ivil (the patient's lifestyle and social context).
