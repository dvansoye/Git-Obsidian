This model divides the world into two domains. Mediocristan is a domain governed by the law of large numbers and normal distributions (the Bell Curve), where no single observation can dramatically affect the total. Extremistan is a domain where a single observation can have a disproportionate impact, and outcomes are dominated by rare, extreme events (Black Swans).

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Sociology & Social Structures]]**: Human physical traits like height and weight belong to Mediocristan. You will never find a human who is ten times taller than the average. However, wealth belongs to Extremistan. A single individual like Jeff Bezos can have more wealth than millions of other people combined.
    
- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: Casino winnings are in Mediocristan; the house has a small edge, and over many bets, the outcome is predictable. Financial markets, however, are in Extremistan. A single day's crash can wipe out years of gains.
    
- **[[Manufacturing & Industrial Arts]]**: The output of a factory is in Mediocristan. Small variations in production exist, but no single car will be twice as fast as the others. Book sales, on the other hand, are in Extremistan. A single blockbuster author can sell more books than all other authors in a category combined.
    
- **[[Public Health]]**: The number of calories consumed per day by a population is in Mediocristan. In contrast, the death toll from a pandemic is in Extremistan. A single viral outbreak can cause a massive, disproportionate number of deaths compared to an average year.
