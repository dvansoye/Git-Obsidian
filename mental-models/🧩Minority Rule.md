The Minority Rule demonstrates that a small, intransigent minority with strong preferences can impose its will on a larger, more flexible majority. This happens when the majority is indifferent or has a low cost to accommodate the minority's preference, creating an asymmetry where the determined few dictate the outcome for the many.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Food Science & Technology]]**: The widespread availability of kosher or halal products is a result of Minority Rule. The majority of the population does not require these certifications, but they are not opposed to them, while the minority that does require them will not consume non-certified products. Therefore, it is more efficient for producers to make everything certified to capture both markets.
    
- **[[Sociology & Social Structures]]**: The shift in social norms around issues like smoking in public places was driven by an intolerant minority that refused to accept secondhand smoke. The flexible majority, while perhaps not initially bothered, had a low cost to comply, leading to widespread bans.
    
- **[[Political Participation & Social Movements]]**: Revolutions and major political shifts are often driven by a small, highly motivated, and uncompromising minority. The general population may be passive or moderately discontent, but it is the intransigent group that forces the change.
    
- **[[Organizational Behavior & HRM]]**: In a corporate setting, a single employee with a severe nut allergy can lead to the entire office becoming a "nut-free" zone. The cost to the majority is low, while the benefit to the intolerant minority is high, so the preference of the one dictates the environment for all.
