Mission Command is a command philosophy that balances centralized intent with decentralized execution. Instead of giving prescriptive orders, leaders provide their subordinates with a clear understanding of the mission's purpose and the desired end state (the "why"). This empowers subordinates to exercise disciplined initiative and adapt their actions (the "how") to unforeseen circumstances, using the leader's intent as their guiding principle.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: An effective CEO empowers their product teams with a clear vision and strategic goals (the intent) but gives them the autonomy to decide on the specific features and development roadmap (the execution). This fosters innovation and allows teams to respond quickly to market feedback.
    
- **[[Education Systems & Pedagogy]]**: A teacher practicing mission command would give students a project with a clear learning objective and a rubric for success (the intent) but allow them to choose their own research topics and methods for presenting the information (the execution), fostering creativity and ownership.
    
- **[[Emergency Services]]**: The Incident Command System (ICS) used by firefighters is a direct parallel. The Incident Commander sets the overall strategy (e.g., "protect the houses on the north flank"), but company officers on the ground have the autonomy to make tactical decisions based on the fire's real-time behavior.
