The Narrative Fallacy describes our tendency to create and believe in coherent stories to explain past events, oversimplifying complex realities and giving us a false sense of understanding and predictability. We are wired to prefer a compact, plausible story over a set of disconnected, complex facts, which makes us vulnerable to misinterpreting the world and underestimating randomness.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Communication & Media Studies]]**: The media often presents complex events like a stock market crash with a simple, linear narrative (e.g., "The market fell today _because_ of news about interest rates"). This ignores the countless other factors and the inherent randomness of the system, but it provides a satisfying, albeit misleading, story.
    
- **[[History]]**: Historical accounts are often shaped into compelling narratives that imply a clear causal chain of events. This can make the rise of a figure like Hitler seem inevitable in retrospect, ignoring the countless contingent and random factors that contributed to it.
    
- **[[Judgment & Decision-Making]]**: When evaluating a business's success, we create a story around its visionary founder, ignoring the roles of luck, timing, and survivorship bias. This leads to the "halo effect," where we attribute all positive outcomes to skill and downplay the role of chance.
    
- **[[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]]**: In our own lives, we construct personal narratives to make sense of our experiences. While psychologically useful, this can lead us to see patterns and causality where none exist, affecting our future decisions based on a flawed understanding of our past.
