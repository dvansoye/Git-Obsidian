The Para-State Model describes how non-state actors, in the absence of effective state control, create a parallel system of governance. These actors establish a localized monopoly on violence, not to overthrow the state, but to sell core state functionsâ€”such as protection, contract enforcement, and dispute resolutionâ€”as a for-profit enterprise within a specific territory or market.

- [[Political Science & Systems]] - Warlords in failed states or insurgent groups in contested territories often establish their own systems of taxation, justice, and social services, effectively operating as a competing government in the areas they control.
    
- [[Business Administration & Management]] - Dominant technology platform companies (e.g., Apple's App Store, Amazon's Marketplace) act as private regulators. They set the rules for their digital ecosystems, resolve disputes between buyers and sellers, and extract "taxes" (fees and commissions) in exchange for providing a stable and secure market.
    
- [[Technology]] - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) built on blockchain technology are attempts to create self-governing digital para-states. They operate with their own treasuries, rules encoded in smart contracts, and voting mechanisms, all existing outside of traditional legal and corporate frameworks.
    
- [[Economic History]] - The historical formation of early European states, as described by Charles Tilly, followed this model. Aspiring rulers acted as "stationary bandits," monopolizing violence in a territory to provide protection in exchange for predictable taxes, eventually evolving this protection racket into a legitimate government.
