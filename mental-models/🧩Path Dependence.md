Path Dependence is a model for understanding how early, often irreversible, decisions create a semi-permanent structural landscape that constrains all future options. In Chess, because pawns cannot move backward, their formation (the "pawn skeleton") dictates the strategic character of the game, creating long-term strengths and weaknesses. This is a direct illustration of Path Dependence, where initial choices can "lock in" a system to a specific trajectory.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Economic History]]**: The QWERTY keyboard is a classic example of path dependence. It was designed to solve a temporary mechanical problem in early typewriters, yet it became "locked in" as the industry standard due to massive switching costs, even though more efficient layouts were later invented.
    
- **[[Sociology & Social Structures]]**: An organization's foundational decisions about its culture, technology, and business model create its institutional "pawn structure." These early choices become embedded as structural constraints that limit future strategic agility and can become permanent liabilities exploited by competitors.
    
- **[[Technology]]**: Early decisions in software architecture are the "pawn moves" of a technology project. Choosing a specific programming language or database creates a path-dependent trajectory that has enduring consequences for the system's scalability, security, and flexibility for the remainder of its lifecycle.
