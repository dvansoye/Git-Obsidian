The Patron-Client Model describes a system of social and power organization built on a network of personal, reciprocal relationships between superiors (patrons) and subordinates (clients). Unlike a formal bureaucracy, this structure operates on a currency of loyalty, obligation, and trust, where patrons provide resources and protection in exchange for the clients' service and support.

- [[Political Science & Systems]] - Political machines in cities often operate on this model, where party bosses (patrons) distribute jobs, services, and favors to voters and precinct captains (clients) in exchange for their votes and political loyalty.
    
- [[Business Administration & Management]] - In many corporate cultures, particularly in "old boys' clubs" or family-run businesses, informal networks of patronage exist where senior executives (patrons) mentor and promote their protÃ©gÃ©s (clients) based on personal loyalty, bypassing formal HR processes.
    
- [[Sociology & Social Structures]] - Feudalism was a societal-scale patron-client system, where lords (patrons) granted land and protection to vassals (clients), who in turn owed military service and a share of their agricultural output.
    
- [[Finance, Banking & Investment]] - The relationship between a top-tier venture capitalist (patron) and a startup founder (client) often extends beyond mere funding. The VC provides crucial network access, mentorship, and industry legitimacy in exchange for equity and the founder's long-term loyalty within their business ecosystem.
