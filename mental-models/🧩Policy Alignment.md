Policy Alignment, derived from Clausewitz's dictum that "war is a continuation of policy by other means," is the master principle that all actions (the "means") must be subordinate to and in service of the ultimate, rational objective (the "policy"). A brilliant tactical victory that undermines the overarching goal is a strategic failure. The model acts as a constant check against the "tyranny of the tactical," ensuring that activity is always purposeful.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: The "policy" is the company's core strategy. The "means" are its daily operations. A software team might ship a feature on time (tactical win), but if that feature confuses the target user and detracts from the core value proposition, it violates the policy and is a strategic failure.
    
- **[[Political Participation & Social Movements]]**: The "policy" is the desired social change. A protest that generates media attention is a tactical win. But if its methods alienate the public and reduce support for the cause, it's a strategic loss because the means undermined the policy.
    
- **[[Productivity]]**: An individual's long-term goal (e.g., writing a book) is their "policy." Answering every email promptly is a tactical success. But if it prevents progress on the book, it is a strategic failure. This model forces a constant prioritization of the important over the merely urgent.
