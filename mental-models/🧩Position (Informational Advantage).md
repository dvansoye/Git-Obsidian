Position is the strategic advantage that comes from acting _after_ other participants in a competitive interaction. The player who acts last has more information, allowing them to make more accurate and profitable decisions. This model teaches that the strategic sequencing of decisions is a critical and often overlooked source of power.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Negotiation]]**: A fundamental tactic is to get the other party to make the first offer. This provides a wealth of information about their priorities and valuation before you have to commit to a position, giving you a significant informational advantage.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: The "second-mover advantage" is a direct application of this principle. A strategic second mover can learn from the first mover's expensive mistakes in product development and market education, entering the market later with a more refined product and a more efficient business model.
    
- **[[Law & Jurisprudence]]**: The discovery process in litigation is a battle for positional advantage. The side that gains a more complete picture of the other side's evidence and arguments before trial can craft their case to exploit weaknesses and neutralize strengths.
