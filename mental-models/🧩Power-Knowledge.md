In-Domain Definition: The Power-Knowledge model collapses the traditional distinction between power and knowledge, arguing they are inextricably intertwined. Power is not simply a repressive force but a productive one that creates "regimes of truth"â€”historically specific systems that define what is considered true or false. Knowledge, in turn, sustains and reinforces the very power structures that produce it.

[[Medical & Health Sciences]] - The "medical gaze" isn't a neutral act of observation but a powerful practice that objectifies the patient's body and produces a diagnosis, a specific "truth" that grants the physician authority. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) doesn't just categorize existing illnesses; it actively constructs what we understand as mental illness, an act of power legitimized by scientific discourse.

[[Law & Jurisprudence]] - The legal system doesn't just punish pre-existing criminals; it produces the very category of "the criminal." Legal discourse shifts the focus from an illegal act to the "delinquent" personality, creating a subject to be managed and disciplined. The judge, in this view, is not an impartial arbiter but a key figure in a power structure that defines and reinforces social norms.

[[Technology]] - Search engine algorithms like Google's PageRank don't just find what's popular; they actively define what is relevant and authoritative, shaping knowledge for billions. Big data and AI create predictive models that categorize individuals and assess risk, an exercise of power legitimized by the discourse of data-driven objectivity.
