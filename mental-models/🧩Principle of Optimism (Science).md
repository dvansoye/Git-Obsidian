All evilsâ€”from poverty and disease to natural disasters and human errorâ€”are caused by insufficient knowledge. This principle reframes problems not as insurmountable barriers or punishments, but as solvable challenges for which we have not yet created the necessary knowledge. It implies that there are no intrinsic limits to progress and that the rational response to any problem is to seek the knowledge required to solve it.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Economic Development & History]]**: Famine and poverty are not caused by a fundamental scarcity of resources, but by a lack of knowledge regarding agricultural techniques, distribution systems, and economic and political organization. The solution to poverty is the creation and application of new knowledge.
    
- **[[Environmental Science & Management]]**: Climate change is not an apocalyptic endpoint but a problem caused by a lack of knowledgeâ€”about clean energy sources, carbon capture technologies, and how to thrive in a changing climate. The optimistic approach is not to halt progress but to accelerate the creation of the knowledge needed to solve the problem.
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: Diseases are not malevolent forces but problems caused by a lack of knowledge about biology and medicine. Every disease that was once a death sentence, from polio to HIV, has been rendered treatable or preventable through the creation of new medical knowledge.
