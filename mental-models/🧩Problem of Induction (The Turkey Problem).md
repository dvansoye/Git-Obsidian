The Problem of Induction highlights the fundamental flaw in using past observations to predict future events, especially in complex systems. The model uses the metaphor of a turkey that is fed for 1,000 days, with each feeding confirming its belief that humans are friendly. On day 1,001, the day before Thanksgiving, this belief is catastrophically falsified. It shows that an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence and that the past can be a dangerously misleading guide to the future.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Investments & Asset Management]]**: An investor who observes the stock market going up for a decade may conclude that it will always go up, ignoring the "hidden" risk of a sudden crash. Their model, based purely on past performance, is a perfect setup for the Turkey Problem.
    
- **[[Strategic Management]]**: A company that has dominated its industry for years may believe its business model is invincible. This inductive confidence makes it blind to disruptive new technologies or changes in consumer behavior that could render it obsolete, as happened to Blockbuster with the rise of streaming.
    
- **[[Public Policy Analysis]]**: A government might see decades of stability in a particular region as proof of permanent peace, leading it to reduce its diplomatic or military readiness. This ignores the possibility of a sudden, unforeseen conflict that invalidates the entire historical dataset.
    
- **[[Engineering]]**: Engineers designing a dam based on the last 100 years of rainfall data are susceptible to the Turkey Problem. They may fail to account for a "thousand-year flood" that lies outside the observed historical range, leading to catastrophic failure. This is why a Margin of Safety is crucial.
