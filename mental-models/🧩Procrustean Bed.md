The Procrustean Bed was named after a figure in Greek mythology who would force his victims to fit the size of his bed by either stretching them or cutting off their limbs, the Procrustean Bed is a metaphor for the harm done by forcing reality to fit a preconceived theory or model. It is the act of manipulating or distorting data, people, or systems to make them conform to a rigid, top-down framework, rather than adjusting the framework to fit the reality.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Organizational Behavior & HRM]]**: A company that forces all its employees, regardless of their roles (e.g., creative designers and accountants), to adhere to the same rigid performance metrics and work schedules is using a Procrustean Bed. It damages morale and performance by ignoring individual differences.
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: A doctor who treats the patient's lab results instead of the patient themselves is falling into this trap. If the patient feels unwell but their numbers are "normal," the doctor might dismiss their concerns, forcing the messy reality of the patient's experience to fit the clean model of the test results.
    
- **[[Education Systems & Pedagogy]]**: Standardized testing can become a Procrustean Bed for education. Instead of fostering genuine curiosity and critical thinking, the system starts "teaching to the test," forcing the rich complexity of learning into the narrow box of what can be easily measured.
    
- **[[Data Science & Analytics]]**: An analyst who tortures the data until it confessesâ€”that is, who keeps running different models until they find one that confirms their initial hypothesisâ€”is using a Procrustean Bed. They are forcing the data to fit their theory, rather than letting the theory be shaped by the data.
