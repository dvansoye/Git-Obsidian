The Reach of an explanation is its ability to solve problems beyond the specific ones it was created to address. Truly fundamental explanations, by capturing deep truths about reality, often have profound and unexpected implications in other domains. Reach is a key indicator that an explanation is a "good explanation" and not just a narrow, ad-hoc solution.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Physics]]**: Newton's laws of motion and gravity were developed to explain the orbits of planets, but their reach was immense. They also explained the motion of projectiles, the tides, and the functioning of machinery, forming the foundation of engineering for centuries.
    
- **[[Biology]]**: The principles of evolution by natural selection were formulated to explain the diversity of species. But their reach extends to explaining the development of the immune system, the behavior of social insects, and even the evolution of cultural ideas (memes).
    
- **[[Information & Communication Technology]]**: The mathematical theory of computation developed by Alan Turing was initially a highly abstract piece of pure mathematics. Its reach, however, turned out to be the entire digital world, providing the foundational principles for every computer and software program that exists today.
