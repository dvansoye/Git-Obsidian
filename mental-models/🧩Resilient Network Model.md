The Resilient Network Model describes a system that is structured to prioritize survival and adaptability over pure efficiency. It favors decentralized, modular, or cellular structures that can absorb targeted attacks and environmental shocks without collapsing. This model recognizes a fundamental trade-off: a centralized hierarchy is efficient but brittle, while a decentralized network is less efficient but far more robust.

- [[Supply Chain & Logistics]] - After the COVID-19 pandemic revealed the brittleness of "just-in-time" manufacturing, companies are redesigning their supply chains for resilience. They are moving from single-sourcing (efficient but fragile) to multi-sourcing and geographic diversification (less efficient but more resilient).
    
- [[Military Science & National Security]] - Modern counter-terrorism strategy focuses on disrupting decentralized terrorist networks. Instead of targeting a single leader, operations aim to identify and remove critical nodes (financiers, bomb makers, communicators) to fragment and isolate the network's cells.
    
- [[Biology]] - An ecosystem's resilience is determined by its biodiversity. A complex ecosystem with many different species and redundant pathways for energy flow can survive the loss of one species. A simple ecosystem, like a monoculture farm, is highly efficient but extremely vulnerable to a single disease or pest.
    
- [[Information & Communication Technology]] - The fundamental architecture of the Internet was designed as a resilient network. Its decentralized nature, with no central hub, ensures that if one part of the network is destroyed or fails, data can simply be rerouted through other pathways, preventing a total system collapse.
