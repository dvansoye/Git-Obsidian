This model emphasizes that the potential value of resources is irrelevant; only their mobilized and coordinated value matters. "Development" is the process of efficiently activating all available assets from a passive state into active, coordinated roles. The goal is to bring the full, synergistic potential of the entire system to bear by prioritizing the activation of the most underutilized resources.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A company's resources (capital, talent, IP) only create value when actively deployed. The chess maxim to "improve your worst-placed piece" serves as a powerful heuristic, suggesting that investing in a weak but critical function (like logistics) can unlock far greater systemic value than adding more resources to an already strong division.
    
- **[[Project Management]]**: A project manager must "develop their pieces" by bringing every team member into the game. Over-relying on a single star performer while leaving others idle is a waste of "tempo." A strategic leader mobilizes the unique skills of the entire team in a coordinated fashion to maximize collective intelligence and resilience.
    
- **[[Economics]]**: "Asset building" in personal and societal economics reflects this model. It's not enough to have a single asset; long-term security requires mobilizing a diverse portfolio of resourcesâ€”savings, education, creditâ€”to create a coordinated and resilient financial foundation.
