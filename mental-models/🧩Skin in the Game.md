Skin in the Game is the principle that actors in a system must bear the consequences of their decisions, both positive and negative. It creates symmetry, accountability, and a powerful filter for separating signal from noise by ensuring that those who make pronouncements or decisions have a personal stake in the outcome.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Public Policy Analysis]]**: Policymakers who have personal wealth tied up in the general economy, rather than in protected government pensions, are more likely to make decisions that foster long-term economic stability. Without this, they receive the upside of power without the downside of their policy failures (an agency problem).
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: Requiring executives to hold a significant amount of company stock aligns their interests with those of shareholders. They are less likely to pursue risky, short-term strategies if their own net worth is on the line.
    
- **[[Military Science & National Security]]**: Throughout history, leaders who fought alongside their soldiers (like Alexander the Great) often inspired greater loyalty and made more calculated decisions because they had direct, physical skin in the game. In contrast, "chickenhawk" leaders who advocate for war without having any personal connection to the costs are a modern example of the lack of it.
    
- **[[Law & Jurisprudence]]**: The ancient Code of Hammurabi stated that if a builder builds a house that collapses and kills the owner, the builder shall be put to death. This is an extreme form of skin in the game, ensuring that builders are incentivized to construct safe and durable homes.
