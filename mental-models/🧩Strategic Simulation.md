Strategic Simulation is a mental model for a higher-level cognitive skill that moves beyond explaining past events to predicting future actions in a novel scenario15. It tests the ability to creatively apply knowledge and synthesize a strategy in a new and unfamiliar context16161616.

[[Business Administration & Management]] - The case-study method used in business schools, where students must apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world, hypothetical problems17.

[[Military Science & National Security]] - War games and simulations where military leaders are presented with novel battlefield scenarios and must develop and execute a strategy in real-time.

[[Law & Jurisprudence]] - Moot court competitions where law students must apply legal principles to a hypothetical case, arguing it as if they were in a real court.
