The Strategic Violence Model views violence not as a random or emotional act, but as a calculated instrument of communication and control in a system lacking formal legal authority. Every act of violence is a message intended for a specific audience, used to enforce contracts, regulate competition, maintain internal discipline, and, most importantly, establish a credible threat that makes the future use of violence unnecessary.

- [[Geopolitics]] - A state's use of military force aligns with this model. A targeted military strike is not just an act of destruction but a political signal to an adversary. Similarly, maintaining a powerful military (a credible threat) is a form of deterrence intended to achieve political goals without resorting to actual conflict.
    
- [[Business Administration & Management]] - Corporate "hardball" tactics can be seen as a non-physical form of strategic violence. Predatory pricing (selling below cost to bankrupt a rival), filing overwhelming lawsuits to drain a competitor's resources, or executing a hostile takeover are all calculated, coercive actions designed to eliminate competition and establish market dominance.
    
- [[Game Theory]] - Establishing a reputation for irrational or disproportionate retaliation can be a highly rational long-term strategy. It changes the payoff matrix for potential challengers, making the perceived cost of any aggressive move so high that they are deterred from acting, allowing the player to achieve their goals without conflict.
    
- [[Economic Theory]] - The protection racket is a perfect economic application of this model. The supplier creates the demand for their service by first introducing the threat of violence (smashing a window) and then selling the solution (protection), demonstrating how violence can be used to create a new market.
