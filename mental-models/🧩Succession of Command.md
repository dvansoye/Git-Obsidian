Succession of Command is a pre-planned, procedural mental model designed to ensure organizational resilience by facilitating a smooth and rapid transfer of authority when a leader is lost. It is a pre-loaded "reboot sequence" with a clear line of succession and a checklist of immediate actions for the new leader to prevent paralysis and maintain cohesion and momentum.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Corporate Governance]]**: A corporation's bylaws explicitly define the line of succession for the CEO and other key executives. This ensures that in the event of a sudden departure, there is no ambiguity about who takes charge, preventing a leadership vacuum that could destabilize the company.
    
- **[[Political Science & Systems]]**: The line of presidential succession in a government is a formalized, large-scale application of this model, ensuring that a clear and legitimate transfer of power occurs in a national emergency.
    
- **[[Operations Management]]**: In project management, a well-defined succession plan for the project lead or key technical experts is critical for risk mitigation. If a key person leaves, the plan dictates who takes over and what immediate steps they must take to keep the project on track.
