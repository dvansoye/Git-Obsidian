Survivorship Bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that "survived" some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility. This leads to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, and we learn the wrong lessons from a skewed dataset.

[[Strategic Management]] - When studying successful companies like Apple or Google, we often emulate their visible strategies. Survivorship bias reminds us to also study the graveyard of tech companies that had similar brilliant ideas but failed due to market timing, poor execution, or bad luckâ€”providing a more complete picture of the risks involved.

[[Investments & Asset Management]] - Looking only at the top-performing mutual funds of the last decade is a classic example. The analysis ignores all the funds that performed poorly and were closed or merged, skewing the perception of average returns and making active management look easier than it is.

[[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]] - We celebrate the college dropout who became a billionaire, but we don't see the thousands of dropouts who struggled financially. This bias can lead to underestimating the value of a traditional education and making riskier life choices.
