Develop a consistent, rule-based symbolic system to encode meaning with precision and efficiency. Based on the semiotic principles of Jacques Bertin's _Semiology of Graphics_, this model uses visual variables (e.g., size, shape, color) as a "grammar" to create a shared visual language. When designed correctly, this allows the user to decode complex information and perceive patterns pre-attentively, "at a glance".

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Data Science & Analytics]]**: The entire field of data visualization is built on this model. Using an "ordered" visual variable like size to represent quantitative data allows the user's brain to intuitively perceive the pattern before consciously reading the values.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A well-designed corporate dashboard is a semiotic system. The consistent use of red for negative trends and green for positive ones creates a shared visual language that allows executives to absorb the state of the business instantly.
    
- **[[Engineering]]**: Formal diagramming languages like Unified Modeling Language (UML) use a strictly defined set of shapes and lines to represent complex software architectures, allowing engineers to collaborate without ambiguity.
