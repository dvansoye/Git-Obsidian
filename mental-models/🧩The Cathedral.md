The Cathedral is a mental model that describes the interconnected elite institutionsâ€”specifically mainstream media, academia, and the permanent government bureaucracyâ€”that work in unison to create and enforce a single, dominant, progressive ideology across society8888.

[[Sociology & Social Structures]] - This is analogous to Antonio Gramsci's theory of "cultural hegemony," where a ruling class maintains power not through force, but by making its own moral and cultural values the societal "common sense"9.

[[Communication & Media Studies]] - The way in which major news outlets, universities, and government agencies often reinforce each other's narratives, creating a monolithic and self-referential information ecosystem10.

[[Organizational Behavior & HRM]] - In a corporate setting, "The Cathedral" could be seen as the combined force of HR, Legal, and senior leadership in enforcing a specific corporate culture and set of values, marginalizing dissenting opinions.
