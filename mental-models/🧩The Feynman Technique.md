The Feynman Technique is a mental model for transforming passive knowledge into deep, active understanding11. It works by forcing you to explain a concept in simple terms, as if you were teaching it to someone else, which immediately reveals any gaps in your own comprehension12.

[[Education Systems & Pedagogy]] - The principle of "Docendo discimus" ("by teaching, we learn"), which is the foundation of effective peer tutoring and study groups13. A student who has to teach a concept to a beginner will quickly discover what they truly understand versus what they have only memorized14.

[[Communication & Media Studies]] - A journalist simplifying a complex scientific study for a general audience must first deeply understand the material to explain it clearly and accurately.

[[Business Administration & Management]] - A manager training a new employee on a complex process must break it down into simple, understandable steps, reinforcing their own mastery of the process.
