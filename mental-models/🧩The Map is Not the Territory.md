The Map is Not the Territory was coined by Alfred Korzybski. This model states that our mental representations of reality (the "map") are not reality itself (the "territory"). All models are, by definition, reductions and simplifications. The danger lies in forgetting this and making decisions based on an incomplete or flawed map as if it were perfectly accurate.

[[Finance, Banking & Investment]] - Financial models that predict stock market behavior (the map) failed spectacularly during the 2008 crisis because they didn't account for certain types of risk and human behavior that existed in the real world (the territory).

[[Operations Management]] - An organizational chart (the map) shows formal reporting lines, but it doesn't show the informal networks of influence and communication (the territory) where the real work often gets done.

[[Medical & Health Sciences]] - A textbook description of a disease (the map) provides a general guideline, but a skilled doctor knows that each patient's symptoms and response to treatment (the territory) can vary significantly.
