Any complex system can be understood by deconstructing it into its constituent thematic layers, analyzing each layer individually, and then observing the emergent patterns and interactions that arise from their combination. This structured approach makes complexity intellectually manageable, and the most profound insights are often found at the intersections and conflicts between the layers.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: To understand a market, a strategist can overlay a **demographic layer**, a **competitor layer**, and a **regulatory layer**. The most valuable opportunities are often found at the intersections of these layers, such as a high-income demographic area with no competitors and favorable zoning.
    
- **[[Organizational Design]]**: An organization can be analyzed through its **formal structure layer** (the org chart), its **social network layer** (informal influence), and its **workflow layer** (how work actually gets done). Major inefficiencies are often found where these layers conflict.
    
- **[[Technology]]**: The OSI model for computer networks deconstructs the complex task of communication into seven distinct layers (e.g., Physical, Application). This allows for modularity and interoperability, as each layer only needs to interface with the ones directly above and below it.
