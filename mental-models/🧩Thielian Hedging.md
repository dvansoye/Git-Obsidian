[[Strategic Management]] - A company invests in both a legacy technology and a disruptive new technology. If the market shifts, the company is positioned to succeed regardless of which technology becomes dominant.

[[Political Science & Systems]] - A political donor contributes to both major candidates in an election, ensuring they have influence regardless of who wins.

[[Military Science & National Security]] - A military strategist develops a plan that "shapes the battlefield," creating multiple simultaneous threats or advantages, ensuring a positive outcome no matter the enemy's response3.
