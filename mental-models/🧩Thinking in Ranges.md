Thinking in Ranges is the cognitive shift from attempting to find a single, deterministic answer to embracing a probabilistic distribution of possibilities. Instead of trying to pinpoint what an opponent _is_ thinking or what the future _will be_, a practitioner assigns a "range" of plausible possibilities and uses new information to update the probabilities within that range, a practical application of Bayesian inference.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Military Science & National Security]]**: Intelligence analysts develop a range of potential enemy courses of action (COAs), rather than predicting a single one. This allows commanders to create flexible plans that can adapt to how the situation actually unfolds, preventing surprise and strategic failure.
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: The process of "differential diagnosis" is functionally identical to thinking in ranges. A physician starts with a broad list of potential diseases based on initial symptoms and uses test results to systematically narrow the range down to the most probable diagnosis.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: Robust strategic planning relies on scenario analysis, which involves developing a range of potential future market conditions (e.g., recession, high growth) and designing a strategy that is resilient across multiple outcomes, rather than betting the company's future on a single forecast.
