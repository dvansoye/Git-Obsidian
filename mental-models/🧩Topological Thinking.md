To understand many complex systems, it is more important to map the network of relationships and connections than to map the precise physical or formal attributes of the components. This model, exemplified by the London Underground map, urges a shift in focus from the _nodes_ of a system to the _links_ between them, as the topology of the network often reveals the most about the system's behavior and leverage points. 

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Organizational Design]]**: A standard org chart is a geometric map of formal hierarchy. A topological map of the same organization, created through social network analysis, reveals the true network of communication and influence, providing a far more useful map for improving efficiency.
    
- **[[Supply Chain & Logistics]]**: A geographic map of factory locations is useful, but a topological map of the supply chain, showing the flow and dependencies between suppliers, plants, and distributors, is more strategic. It makes it possible to identify critical bottlenecks and single points of failure that are invisible on a purely geographic map.
    
- **[[Systems Thinking]]**: Causal loop diagrams are pure topological maps. They deliberately ignore the specific values of variables (nodes) to map the underlying structure of feedback loops (links) that drive a system's behavior over time.
