Troop Leading Procedures (TLPs) are a cognitive checklist or scaffold for planning and preparing for a complex task under time pressure. The eight-step process breaks down the task into a logical, sequential series of actions, ensuring that no critical element is missed and that subordinates are given the maximum time to prepare. It is a model for structured, thorough thinking in a stressful environment.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Operations Management]]**: The "DMAIC" (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) process in Six Sigma is a direct analogue. It is a structured, step-by-step framework that guides a team through a complex process improvement project, ensuring a logical flow from problem identification to solution implementation.
    
- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: A pre-flight checklist used by pilots or a surgical safety checklist used by medical teams are simplified versions of TLPs. They are cognitive tools designed to ensure that all critical steps are performed in the correct sequence before a high-stakes procedure begins.
    
- **[[Personal Productivity]]**: When faced with a large personal project, an individual can create their own TLP-like checklist: 1. Define the goal. 2. Announce the project to stakeholders. 3. Brainstorm a rough plan. 4. Gather resources. 5. Do initial research. 6. Finalize the plan. 7. Communicate the final plan. 8. Execute and review.
