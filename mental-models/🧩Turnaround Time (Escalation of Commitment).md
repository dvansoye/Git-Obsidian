A Turnaround Time is a pre-commitment strategy that sets a hard, objective limit on an endeavor to counteract the powerful psychological pull of irrational decision-making in a compromised state. It is a rational rule, made in a calm state, designed to override the cognitive biases of the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** and **Escalation of Commitment**, which compel us to continue a failing course of action because of the resources we have already invested.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Finance, Banking & Investment]]**: A **stop-loss order** is a financial "turnaround time." It is a pre-commitment to automatically sell a stock if it drops to a certain price, preventing an investor from succumbing to the sunk cost fallacy and holding onto a losing position in the irrational hope that it will recover.
    
- **[[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]]**: This model is a direct antidote to the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**. A person who has spent years in a failing relationship might continue to invest in it to justify their past efforts. A pre-committed "turnaround time" (e.g., "If things do not improve in six months, I will leave") can serve as a circuit breaker to this irrational loop.
    
- **[[Geopolitics]]**: Military interventions often suffer from "mission creep," a form of escalation of commitment where objectives expand to justify the continued investment of lives and resources. Establishing a strict set of exit criteria at the outset of an operationâ€”a political "turnaround time"â€”can be a powerful tool to prevent this dangerous dynamic.
