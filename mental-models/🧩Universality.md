Everything that is not forbidden by the laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge. This principle posits that the laws of physics permit the existence of "universal constructors"â€”machines that can produce any physically possible transformation. Human knowledge itself is a step toward this universality, as our ability to understand and manipulate the world is limited not by our physical nature, but only by what the laws of physics allow.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Information & Communication Technology]]**: A universal Turing machine (i.e., any modern computer) is a limited but powerful example of universality. It can perform any computation that any other computer can, demonstrating that a single, universal system can encompass the repertoire of all others.
    
- **[[Technology]]**: The development of universal technologies like writing, printing, and the internet shows a trend toward universality. The alphabet, a universal system for representing speech, replaced thousands of specific pictograms, dramatically increasing the efficiency and reach of knowledge.
    
- **[[Biology]]**: DNA is a universal replicator. The same genetic code and replication machinery is used, with minor variations, across almost all life on Earth, demonstrating how a single, universal system can be used to construct a vast and diverse range of organisms.
