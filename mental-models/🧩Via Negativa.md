Via Negativa is the principle that we often know what is wrong better than we know what is right, and that knowledge grows by subtraction. In a complex and uncertain world, it is often more robust to focus on removing the bad (what we know is harmful) than on pursuing a specific definition of the good (which may have unforeseen negative consequences).

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Medical & Health Sciences]]**: It is easier to identify things that are definitively bad for health (e.g., smoking, excessive sugar) than it is to define the perfect diet. A robust health strategy, therefore, focuses on eliminating known harms.
    
- **[[Judgment & Decision-Making]]**: When making a major life decision, it can be more effective to first eliminate all the clearly bad options. This process of subtraction simplifies the choice and reduces the risk of a catastrophic error. Charlie Munger's practice of "inversion" is a form of Via Negativa.
    
- **[[Philosophy]]**: The "Silver Rule" ("Do not do unto others what you would not have them do unto you") is a form of Via Negativa. It is more robust and less intrusive than the "Golden Rule" because it avoids imposing your own definition of "good" on others.
    
- **[[Strategic Management]]**: A company can improve its performance by focusing on eliminating inefficiencies, bad processes, and toxic employees (subtraction) rather than searching for a single "magic bullet" initiative (addition).
