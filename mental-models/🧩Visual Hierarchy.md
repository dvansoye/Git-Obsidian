In any communication, you must consciously and deliberately direct your audience's attention to what matters most by creating a clear hierarchy of importance. Based on the Gestalt psychology principle of "figure-ground perception," this model uses visual variables like size, color, and contrast to make the most important information the undeniable "figure," while supporting context recedes into the "ground." If everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Leadership]]**: An effective leader running a meeting establishes a clear hierarchy with an agenda, ensuring the most important topics (the "figure") are addressed. A meeting with a "flat" hierarchy wanders aimlessly because no one knows what the "figure" is supposed to be.
    
- **[[Technology]]**: The design of a webpage is an exercise in creating visual hierarchy. The primary call-to-action (e.g., "Add to Cart") is made the most prominent element through size and color, guiding the user's actions and reducing cognitive load.
    
- **[[Psychology & Behavioral Sciences]]**: This model is used in behavioral design to "nudge" choices. On a pricing page, the "Recommended" plan is often made larger and brighter, making it the perceptual "figure" and subtly guiding the customer's decision.
