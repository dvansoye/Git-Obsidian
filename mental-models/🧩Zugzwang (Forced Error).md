Zugzwang ("compulsion to move") is a situation where a player is put at a disadvantage precisely _because_ it is their turn to act. Any available move fatally weakens their position, yet the rules of the system compel them to make one. This model is about engineering the decision-making environment so that the opponent's obligation to act becomes the instrument of their own downfall.

**Concrete Applications:**

- **[[Negotiation]]**: "Hardball" tactics like "exploding offers" with an artificially short deadline are designed to induce zugzwang. They remove the option to wait and deliberate, forcing the other party to make a decision from a position of weakness and with incomplete information.
    
- **[[Economic Theory]]**: The "patent cliff" places pharmaceutical companies in zugzwang. Knowing a blockbuster drug's patent will expire, they _must_ act to replace the lost revenue. However, all available optionsâ€”risky R&D, costly acquisitionsâ€”are fraught with peril. The compulsion to move is forced by an external rule, and every move is dangerous.
    
- **[[Business Administration & Management]]**: A market leader facing a disruptive technology is often in zugzwang. Ignoring the disruption leads to obsolescence, but embracing it means cannibalizing their profitable legacy business for an unproven, low-margin one. They are compelled to act, but any action worsens their immediate position.
