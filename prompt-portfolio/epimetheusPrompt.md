# Prompt

```
I have uploaded all of my diary entries for the past period. 

# Accomplishments

What have I accomplished? 

1. '- [ ]` means I didn't complete it. `- [X]` means I did complete it. 
2. I'm looking for a summary so combine like items. 
3. Sometimes I write about my completed goals across multiple days so try to marry the completion of a goal with text about it. 
4. Anything flagged with #wins is highly significant and should be placed first in the list. Add a #wins to the end of the line so that I know I considered in an important milestone.
5. All goals should be written in the first person (I/my).

# Goals

What goals implied or explicit can you determine by this list? Many are just "ideas" which I wrote down without judging them. But if you see patterns then possibly this would be a good candidate for a goal. 

# Meta-motivations

What do you think is behind all of these goals? What are my fears and aspirations? 

# Recommendations 

What ideas would be worth pursuing and why?
//end report

# Output Instructions

Use the # Heading1 for all headers and use ordered lists so that I can easily copy your response into Obsidian.
