# Summary

1. I have made significant progress in automating my "Summarization Suite" workflow using Comet, successfully training it to run all five prompts sequentially. This is a major step towards my goal of further automation. #wins
2. I successfully figured out that the "Lazy Plugin loader" was causing issues with my Obsidian plugin settings, resolving a frustrating technical problem.
3. I have been consistently drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning.
4. My Tinnitus symptoms have improved by about 50%, and at times it is barely noticeable. #wins
5. My Bruxism has stopped since I started taking GlyNAC.
6. My heart palpitations have much improved.
7. I have been successful in creating both \[\[Epimetheus\]\] and \[\[Prometheus\]\] and connecting them together. #wins
8. I have experienced a significant improvement in my bladder symptoms, to the point where they are almost gone. #wins
9. I have figured out a potential link between my low Neutrophils, dehydration, and bladder irritation. #wins
10. I have been taking a number of supplements, including Lion's Mane, L-Theanine, GlyNAC, Marshmallow Root, and Prelief, and have seen positive results.
11. I have been making an effort to spend more time with Sandy and disengage from arguments by journaling.
12. I have been making progress on my "Atlas" project, including researching potential condos and loan options.
13. I am making progress on my goal of "Synthetic Learning" by summarizing "The Sublime Object of Ideology" by Slavoj Žižek and creating a latticework report on his work.
14. I have made progress in organizing my prompts and mental models in GitHub.

# Goals

1. **Optimize Health and Wellbeing:** I am intensely focused on improving my sleep quality, reducing urinary urgency, alleviating tinnitus, and understanding the root causes of my symptoms through self-experimentation with supplements (GlyNAC, Marshmallow Root, Prelief), diet, and lifestyle changes (e.g., hydration, caffeine reduction).
2. **Achieve "Transcendence" through Accelerated Learning:** I want to transcend normal human limitations by systematically applying technology and knowledge. This involves a focus on "Synthetic Learning" (e.g., summarizing books with AI), building a "Latticework of Mental Models," and developing a "Cognitive Operating System" for acquiring, comprehending, retaining, and applying knowledge.
3. **Automate and Optimize Workflows:** I am driven to automate my processes to create leverage and efficiency. This includes automating my "Summarization Suite" with Comet, organizing my prompts in GitHub, and developing a system to automatically surface relevant information (Prometheus).
4. **Strategic Relocation ("Atlas"):** I am actively planning to sell my condo in Palm Desert and relocate to Washington to be closer to family and to create a more financially optimized and geographically flexible lifestyle.
5. **Write and Create:** I have a desire to write a series of articles ("Bicycle" series) and create content that establishes me as a thought leader, but I am facing internal resistance and struggling to prioritize it.
6. **Improve Relationships:** I am working on being a better leader in my relationship with Sandy and being more present and supportive for my family in Washington.

# Meta-motivations

- **Fears:** I am afraid of getting sick, getting old, losing my mind, and becoming obese. I am also concerned about societal crises (financial, ecological, political) and the possibility of a market downturn. I fear being "stuck" in a life that doesn't align with my values and goals.
- **Aspirations:** I aspire to achieve "Transcendence" – a state of intellectual and personal optimization that creates maximum leverage and freedom. I want to be cognitively enhanced, financially optimized, geographically flexible, and influential. I am driven by a desire to overcome my limitations and live up to my full potential.

# Recommendations

1. **Prioritize "The Triplely-Nested Loop":** My diary entries reveal a powerful reinforcing loop between sleep, learning, and process improvement. I should double down on this. When my sleep is good, my mind is clear and I can learn and create. When I learn and create, I am motivated to improve my processes, which in turn frees up time and energy to focus on my health. I should continue to prioritize sleep hygiene and my health experiments as the foundation for everything else.
2. **Embrace "Synthetic Learning" as my Primary Focus:** My goal of reading a "book" a day through AI-powered summaries and analyses is a high-leverage activity that aligns perfectly with my goal of "Transcendence." I should make this my "North Star" for the time being. I can use my "Summarization Suite" to process a book each day and then use "cato" to help me internalize and apply the key concepts.
3. **Address the "Writing Resistance":** My desire to write the "Bicycle" series is a recurring theme, but it's also a source of anxiety. I should reframe this. Instead of seeing it as a separate, daunting task, I can view it as the natural output of my "Synthetic Learning" process. Each book I summarize, each latticework report I create, is a potential seed for an article. I can start small by simply sharing my most interesting findings from my daily summaries. This will lower the activation energy and help me build momentum.
4. **Systematize my Health Experiments:** I am running multiple health experiments at once (GlyNAC, Prelief, Marshmallow Root, etc.) and it's becoming difficult to track the variables. I should create a more structured process for this. I can focus on one variable at a time, track my symptoms and Oura ring data in a dedicated log, and use this data to make more informed decisions about what's working.
