Title: Oct Mid-Month Status Report
Author: [[Darren Van Soye]]


Tags: [[Personal Development]]

This report was created by Epimetheus on behalf of Darren Van Soye. Darren and I are working together to [[Humans + Al]] to help him focus his attention on the areas of [[ðŸ§©Leverage|high-leverage]] with the overarching goal of [[Transcendence]]. The report (along with other information) is used by another prompt - Prometheus to find relevant and high-leverage content for Darren's areas of interest.

I am using version 2.0.0 of epimetheusPrompt.

Status Report for the diary entries between 2025-10-12 to 2025-10-21.

## Accomplishments

1. I identified magnesium deficiency as a potential unifying root cause for nearly all my symptoms, developing a detailed hypothesis involving stress, cortisol, the HPA axis, and glucocorticoid receptor function. This insight emerged from synthesizing personal observations, research summaries, and AI discussions (Oct 19, Oct 20). #wins.
2. I achieved a sleep milestone by sleeping until 1:46 AM before the first wake-up, despite being in a suboptimal hotel environment (Oct 14). #wins.
3. I recognized that supplements alone cannot fully resolve my sleep issues, acknowledging the significant impact of stress and constipation (Oct 16). #wins.
4. My Tinnitus symptoms have noticeably improved, sometimes being barely perceptible (Oct 21). #wins.
5. I developed a Magnesium Effectiveness Rubric to systematically track the impact of increased magnesium supplementation on my key symptoms and biometrics (Oct 20). #wins.
6. I made progress on the [[Atlas]] project by researching WA property tax rules for retirees and engaging in discussions with Sandy about potential locations (West Seattle) and the emotional/financial implications of moving (Oct 16, Oct 18).
7. I applied the [[Judge and Jury Model]] to gain clarity on the potential regret associated with *not* acting on the Seattle move (Oct 20). #wins.
8. I researched GlyNAC dosing, toxicity, and potential benefits for nerve pain (Oct 13, Oct 14).
9. I investigated the relationship between constipation and urinary urgency (Oct 16).
10. I researched detrusor muscle overactivity, stress links, and potential treatments (Oct 17).
11. I stopped several bladder-related supplements (Prelief, Marshmallow Root, Chondroitin/Glucosamine) to isolate variables for the magnesium experiment (Oct 17).
12. I brainstormed improvements for the [[2025-10-24 AI Prometheus Report]], focusing on query diversification and avoiding duplicate results (Oct 14).
13. I completed various practical tasks like making backups, managing Pop's Norton subscription, oiling my chair, and fixing the TTP website after an outage (Oct 12, Oct 16, Oct 19, Oct 20, Oct 21).
14. I updated and added context files (My Symptoms, My Supplements, My Books) to GitHub for better AI support (Oct 12).
15. I added 'Total Sleep Time' to my Magnesium Rubric (Oct 21).

## Goals

1. **Diagnose and Resolve Root Health Issues:** My primary focus is confirming and treating the suspected chronic magnesium deficiency. This involves systematically titrating magnesium dosage, meticulously tracking effects using the new rubric, and understanding the interplay between magnesium, cortisol, stress (HPA axis), and my constellation of symptoms (poor sleep, low HRV, tinnitus, bruxism, palpitations, urinary urgency, itching, constipation, etc.). I aim to find the highest [[ðŸ§©Leverage]] interventions to break negative feedback loops. I also want to research pharmacological approaches for [[Tinnitus]] and potentially create diagrams to visualize my condition.
2. **Optimize Sleep Quality:** Specifically target [[Sleep Maintenance Insomnia]] and low [[Deep Sleep]] by addressing the potential magnesium deficiency, managing stress, refining evening routines (e.g., timing of supplements, walks, food), and potentially exploring [[Bladder Training]] or other strategies to reduce nighttime voiding.
3. **Enhance Learning and Workflow Automation ([[Recursive Self-Improvement]]):** Improve the [[Prometheus]] prompt system by implementing strategies like "Query Evolution" and storing responses in GitHub to avoid duplicates and increase the relevance/entropy of suggestions. Explore creating persistent memory for Gemini or other methods for Just-In-Time (JIT) support based on recent diary entries. Continue automating knowledge processing workflows (like potentially summarizing highlights/reactions).
4. **Advance [[Atlas]] Project (Relocation Decision):** Move forward with the decision process regarding relocating to the Seattle area. This involves addressing the emotional stress and relationship dynamics with Sandy, gathering more information, potentially setting go/no-go milestones, and preparing the current condo (tile/grout work) for a potential sale.
5. **Manage Stress and Improve Relationships:** Actively work on managing personal stress triggers (identified significantly in Oct 18 entry) and implement strategies for better communication and conflict resolution with Sandy (e.g., journaling, empathy, clear agreements). Continue managing interactions with Pop effectively.
6. **Refine Supplement Strategy:** Continue experimenting with [[GlyNAC]], determine optimal timing and dosage for [[Magnesium]], and potentially simplify the overall supplement regimen based on effectiveness.

## Meta-motivations

1. **Fear of Decline and Being Trapped:** I have a significant underlying fear of physical and cognitive decline (aging, illness, losing my mind) and a fear of being trapped by circumstances (health limitations, economic downturns, political instability, geographic location). My drive for health optimization and the [[Atlas]] project are partly fueled by a desire to mitigate these risks and maintain agency (Oct 16, Oct 18, Oct 20).
2. **Aspiration for [[Transcendence]] and Control:** My core aspiration remains [[Transcendence]] through optimization. I strive to understand and control the complex systems governing my health, learning, and life circumstances. This manifests in my detailed self-tracking, systematic experimentation, desire for automation, and application of [[Systems Thinking]] and mental models (Oct 19, Oct 20).
3. **Drive for [[ðŸ§©Leverage]] and Efficiency:** I am constantly seeking the highest-[[ðŸ§©Leverage]] points to solve problems â€“ identifying magnesium as a potential single key to multiple symptoms is a prime example. My focus on automation and workflow optimization stems from this desire to achieve more with less effort (Oct 21).
4. **Need for Understanding and Problem Solving:** I possess a deep-seated need to deconstruct problems, understand their root causes (evident in the detailed analysis of my health issues), and engineer solutions. This analytical drive applies to my health, my learning processes, and even relational dynamics (Oct 17, Oct 19).

## Recommendations

1. **Intensify Focus on the Magnesium-Stress-Sleep Axis:** Given the potential explanatory power of magnesium deficiency across nearly all my symptoms and its direct link to stress (which I identified as a major factor), this experiment should be my absolute top priority. I should use the rubric diligently, titrate dosage carefully as planned, *and* simultaneously implement concrete stress-reduction techniques (like the breathwork mentioned Oct 17) to address the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]] overdrive from both biochemical and behavioral angles. This offers the highest potential [[ðŸ§©Leverage]].
2. **Systematize the [[Prometheus]] Improvement Loop:** I have identified key weaknesses (duplicates, entropy) and potential solutions (query evolution, storing history). I should formally implement one experiment (e.g., adding "Explorer" queries as discussed Oct 14) for the next week, track the results (quality/novelty of links), and iterate. This [[Recursive Self-Improvement]] applied to my idea generation tool is crucial for my learning goals.
3. **Apply [[ðŸ§©No-Fall Zone (The Irreversible Decision)]] / [[ðŸ§©Turnaround Time (Escalation of Commitment)]] to [[Atlas]]:** The Seattle move feels overwhelming partly due to its perceived irreversibility (like a Type 1 decision or No-Fall Zone). I should break it down into smaller, reversible stages with clear "go/no-go" criteria or pre-defined "turnaround times" (as mentioned Oct 16). For example: Stage 1 Goal: Agree on 3 real estate agents to interview by Nov 15. Go/No-Go: Do we feel confident in *any* of them? If yes, proceed to Stage 2. If no, pause and reassess (the Turnaround Time). This reduces the feeling of a single, massive leap.
4. **Schedule Dedicated "Relationship Maintenance" Time:** My entries highlight recurring stress related to disagreements with Sandy, often stemming from differing priorities or communication styles (Oct 16, Oct 18). Just as I schedule exercise and learning, I could schedule brief, dedicated check-ins with Sandy *specifically* about project progress (like Atlas tasks) and emotional states *before* tensions build. This makes addressing potential conflicts proactive rather than reactive.

## Cutting Room Floor

1. **Create bespoke diagram(s) to describe my condition using Excalidraw (Oct 21):** This task directly supports my primary goal of understanding the complex interplay of factors affecting my health (Magnesium, Cortisol, HPA axis, [[Sympathetic Nervous System]], [[Detrusor Muscle]], etc.). Visualizing these connections via [[Systems Thinking]] could unlock new insights and identify [[ðŸ§©Leverage]] points more effectively than text alone. It connects directly to Goal #1 and Meta-motivation #4.
2. **Capture recent diary entries in GitHub using [[Epimetheus]] for [[Prometheus]] JIT support (Oct 21):** This aligns strongly with Goal #3 (Workflow Automation) and Meta-motivation #3 (Leverage). Making recent thoughts and current problems programmatically available to [[Prometheus]] would significantly increase the relevance and timeliness of its suggestions, accelerating my [[Recursive Self-Improvement]] loop for learning.
3. **Use comet to find the pharmacological approaches to [[Tinnitus]] (Oct 21):** While I am currently focused on the magnesium hypothesis, [[Tinnitus]] remains a significant, long-standing symptom (Goal #1). Systematically researching established or emerging pharmacological options represents a parallel path to potential relief if the magnesium/stress approach isn't fully effective, providing valuable [[Optionality]].
